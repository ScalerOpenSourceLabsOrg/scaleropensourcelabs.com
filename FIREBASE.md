# Firebase setup

Everything you need to make the join form actually store applications, and the
reasoning behind the parts that look odd. Written for somebody who has not touched
this repo before.

**You do not need any of this to work on the site.** The site builds, renders and
passes every check with no Firebase project and no `.env.local`. With Firebase
unconfigured the join form renders and validates exactly as normal and tells the
reader plainly that it is not connected. Only set this up if you are working on the
form itself or standing up the real thing.

---

## Quick start

The whole thing, assuming you have a Firebase project already. **Read step 3 and step
4 in full before running them** — one console setting and one deploy are what stand
between this and publishing every applicant's email address.

```bash
# 1. point the CLI at your project (once per machine)
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
cd /path/to/tracje          # repo root — firebase.json lives here
firebase use --add

# 2. deploy the security rules. NOT optional, and not done by the console.
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 3. fill in the six config values from the Firebase console
cd web
cp .env.example .env.local
$EDITOR .env.local

# 4. run it and submit the form for real
npm run dev                 # then open http://localhost:3000/join

# 5. before you change any form option later
npm run rules               # asserts the rules still match the form
```

In the Firebase console you need, in this order: a project → a **web app** (for the
config values) → **Firestore in production mode** → rules deployed → **App Check**
before launch. Each is a numbered step below.

## What it does

Members sign in, answer three questions once, land on a dashboard, and can enrol in the
GSoC mentorship cohort. Organisers read the roster and publish the mentors.

                                 readable by every member
```

No server, no admin SDK, no API route. The site stays a static build; everything is the
client talking to Firestore under the rules.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `firestore.rules` | **The security boundary.** Read this one properly. |
| `firebase.json` | Rules path, emulator ports, and the Hosting config. |
| `web/lib/firebase.ts` | Lazy client init, collection names, the allowed domain. |
| `web/lib/auth.tsx` | Sign-in, sign-out, and the admin check. |
| `web/lib/profile.ts` | The profile shape and its read/write. |
| `web/lib/batch.ts` | Batch, branch and roll, parsed out of the college address. |
| `web/lib/mentorship.ts` | Mentors and enrolments. |
| `web/components/JoinGate.tsx` | The door: `/join`, sign-in only. |
| `web/components/MemberOnly.tsx` | The three states before "signed in", shared by both member routes. |
| `web/components/ProfileForm.tsx` | The three questions. |
| `web/components/MemberDashboard.tsx` | `/dashboard`. Also decides who still needs onboarding. |
| `web/components/MentorPicker.tsx` | Enrolment and the preference picker. |
| `web/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` | The organisers' view. |
| `web/components/AdminMentors.tsx` | Publishing, editing, hiding and deleting mentors. |
| `web/components/AdminMentorship.tsx` | Who enrolled, and the demand per mentor. |
| `web/scripts/rules.mjs` | Text check: rules vs the form. Runs in CI. |
| `web/scripts/rules-emulator.mjs` | Executes the rules as several different users. |
| `web/scripts/e2e-auth.mjs` | Drives the whole flow in a real browser. |
| `web/.env.example` | The variables, with notes. |

Five collections:

| Collection | Who can read | Who can write |
|---|---|---|
| `users/{uid}` | that member, and admins | that member only, validated |
| `admins/{email}` | your own row only | **nobody, from any client** |
| `mentors/{id}` | every signed-in member | **admins** — see below |
| `enrollments/{uid}` | that member, and admins | that member only, validated |
| `applications/{id}` | nobody | nobody — legacy, kept sealed |

**`mentors` is the one collection a client may write that is not its own row.** That
widening was deliberate, and it is acceptable because a mentor entry is published,
organiser-authored, non-personal copy — the worst a stolen admin session can do there is
deface a list. The same argument does **not** hold for `admins`, which is why every client
write to that collection stays denied: appointing an admin is the one privilege escalation
this model would otherwise allow.

**Nothing about a member's batch is stored anywhere.** `23bcs10045` in
`asha.23bcs10045@sst.scaler.com` is the 2023–27 batch, branch BCS, roll 10045, and
`web/lib/batch.ts` reads it on demand. The rules pin the stored address to
`request.auth.token.email`, so a value derived from it cannot be forged and cannot drift
out of step with the document it describes. The consequence to know about: you cannot
*query* by batch, because it is not a field — the organisers' dashboard filters in the
browser over a membership it has already read.

---

## Setup

### 1. Create the project

<https://console.firebase.google.com> → **Add project**. Analytics is not needed and
not used; skip it.

### 2. Create a web app and copy the config

**Project settings** (gear icon) → **General** → **Your apps** → **Add app** → the
web icon (`</>`). Register it, and Firebase shows a `firebaseConfig` object.

Copy `web/.env.example` to `web/.env.local` and fill in the six values:

```bash
cd web
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789012
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789012:web:abc123
```

All six must be present. A partially filled config is treated as unconfigured on
purpose — one that initialises and then fails on every request is much harder to
diagnose than one that declines to start.

> **`NEXT_PUBLIC_` is correct here and is not a mistake.** A Firebase web config is
> an identifier, not a credential. Google documents it as publishable and it is
> inlined into the browser bundle by design. Nothing is protected by hiding it; what
> protects applicants is `firestore.rules`. Do not "fix" this by adding a server-side
> proxy — you would be hiding a public identifier and still relying on the same rules.
>
> A **service account key** is the opposite and must never go in this repo or in any
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.

### 3. Create the database

**Build** → **Firestore Database** → **Create database**. Pick a region close to your
users (`asia-south1` for India) — **the region cannot be changed later.**

When it asks for a starting mode:

> ### Choose "production mode", not "test mode".
>
> Test mode is `allow read, write: if true` for thirty days. Applications contain
> students' names, emails, and college year and branch — test mode makes every one of
> them readable by anyone who opens the site and types two lines into the browser
> console. **This is the single most important step on this page.**
>
> If you already chose test mode, that is fine — step 4 replaces the rules entirely.
> Just do step 4 now rather than later.

### 4. Deploy the rules

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools     # once
firebase login                    # once
cd /path/to/tracje                # repo root, where firebase.json lives
firebase use --add                # pick your project, give it any alias
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

> **Editing `firestore.rules` changes nothing until you deploy it.** A rules file that
> is correct in git and permissive in production is the worst case, because code review
> passes. After deploying, confirm in the console under **Firestore → Rules** that what
> you see matches the file.

What the rules say, in short:

- Only a **verified @sst.scaler.com** account can do anything at all.
- A member may read and write **their own** `users/{uid}` document, validated against the
  form's exact field set, length limits and closed value lists.
- `email`, `uid` and `created_at` are **frozen after the first save**.
- Only an **admin** may list the membership. No client may delete a profile — including
  admins, and including its owner.
- `admins` cannot be written by any client, so a compromised admin session cannot appoint
  more admins.
- Every other path in the project — closed.

### 5. App Check (do this before launch)

Writes now require a signed-in @sst.scaler.com account, so the open-endpoint problem is
much smaller than it was — but App Check is still worth having: it attests that requests
come from this app rather than from a script replaying a stolen token.

**Build** → **App Check** → register the web app with **reCAPTCHA v3**. Put the site
key in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APPCHECK_KEY=6Lc...
```

Leave it **empty locally** — reCAPTCHA cannot be exercised on `localhost` without a
debug token, and the client is written to carry on without App Check rather than fail,
so a real applicant can still apply if attestation breaks.

> Turn **enforcement** on in the console only *after* confirming real submissions carry
> a token. Enforcing first rejects genuine applicants, and the error they see is
> indistinguishable from the site being broken.

### 6. Check it actually works

```bash
cd web && npm run dev
```

Open `/join`. You should get **"Sign in with your college account"**. Sign in with an
`@sst.scaler.com` Google account, fill the profile, and save — you should land on
**"You're in the club."** with your details listed, and a new document under
**Firestore → Data → users**, whose id is your Auth uid.

Then try it with a personal Gmail account: sign-in should refuse it and say so.

If you get anything else, the troubleshooting table below names the likely cause.

---

### 7. Deploying to production

Two things are easy to miss here, and both present as "it worked on my machine".

**`.env.local` is not deployed.** It is gitignored, so the host has never seen it. Set
the same variables in your host's environment settings — on Vercel that is
**Project → Settings → Environment Variables**. All six `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
values, plus `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APPCHECK_KEY` for production.

**They are inlined at BUILD time, not read at run time.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables
are baked into the JavaScript bundle when `next build` runs. Adding or changing one
therefore does nothing to the site already deployed — **you must redeploy**, not just
restart. A variable that is set correctly in the dashboard and absent from the bundle
is the most confusing version of this bug, and the form will simply say it is not
connected.

To confirm which values actually shipped, load the deployed `/join` and submit: if it
says "not connected to anything yet", the build did not have them.

Also add your production domain under **Firebase console → Authentication → Settings →
Authorized domains** if you later add any Firebase Auth. Firestore writes do not need
it; App Check's reCAPTCHA does — register the domain in the **App Check** section.

---

## Testing it without a Firebase project

You can run the entire form — real submit, real rules, a real database you can browse —
with **no Firebase project and no credentials**, using the emulator. Do this before
touching production. It is also the only honest way to test a change to
`firestore.rules`.

Needs Java (the emulator is a JAR) and nothing else.

```bash
# terminal 1 — from the repo root
npx firebase-tools emulators:start --only firestore --project demo-osc

# terminal 2 — point the site at it
cd web
cat > .env.local <<'ENV'
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-osc
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR=127.0.0.1:8080
ENV
npm run dev
```

Submit the form at `/join`, then open **<http://127.0.0.1:4000/firestore>** and you
will see the document. Rules are enforced exactly as in production, so a submission
that the emulator accepts is one production will accept.

The `demo-` project prefix is what makes this safe: the SDK refuses to reach real
Google services for it, so there is no way to accidentally write into the organisers'
actual collection.

Delete `.env.local` when you are done, or the form will keep pointing at an emulator
that is no longer running.

**Shortcut:** with `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIRESTORE_EMULATOR` in `.env.local`, plain `npm run dev`
starts the Auth + Firestore emulator for you (or reuses one already running), and saves
its data on Ctrl+C to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\osc-dev\emulator-data` (`~/.cache/osc-dev/...`
elsewhere; override with `OSC_EMULATOR_DATA`), so accounts survive restarts. Delete
that folder for a clean slate. `npm run dev:next` is the old, Next-only command.

### Testing the whole flow in a browser

```bash
# emulators running, dev server on 3007, then:
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3007 npm run e2e:auth
```

29 assertions that drive a real browser through the whole journey: a gmail.com account
refused by name, a college account through to the details form, `?path=` surviving the
sign-in step, the save, the **edit** (the path that only breaks the second time somebody
uses the page), a member refused the dashboard, and an organiser served it with all six
breakdowns.

It also reads the stored document back with the owner token — the only way to check what
was written, since the rules forbid a client read — and asserts the document id is the auth
uid, the stored address is the signed-in one, and `created_at` stayed put while
`updated_at` moved.

**It is the only check that would catch a CSP mistake breaking sign-in.** Google sign-in
needs `apis.google.com` in `script-src` and the auth domain in `frame-src`; with either
missing the page renders perfectly, the button is present, the click does nothing, and the
only trace is a console violation. That happened, and this is what found it.

### Testing the rules directly

```bash
npm run rules:emulator      # with the emulator running
```

Eighteen assertions: that a genuine application is accepted, that optional fields are
genuinely optional, and that reads, updates, deletes, writes to other collections,
out-of-set values, extra fields, malformed emails, oversized fields, missing required
fields and a client-forged timestamp are all refused.

Run it whenever you touch `firestore.rules` or the form's fields. `npm run rules` is
the cheap text check that runs in CI; this one actually executes the rules, which is
the difference between "the file says `allow read: if false`" and "a read was attempted
and refused".

> **A trap worth knowing.** If you query the emulator over its REST API to check your
> data, an unauthenticated read returns an **empty list rather than an error**, because
> `allow read: if false` denies it. That looks exactly like "my write silently failed".
> Add the emulator's admin bypass:
>
> ```bash
> curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer owner" \
>   "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/projects/demo-osc/databases/(default)/documents/applications"
> ```
>
> Or just use the emulator UI, which is already privileged.

---

## Authentication (required — the join form needs it)

Registration is Google sign-in restricted to **@sst.scaler.com**. Two console steps, and
sign-in fails with a confusing error if either is missed.

### 1. Enable the Google provider

**Authentication → Sign-in method → Add new provider → Google → Enable.** Set the support
email to the club address and save.

Without this, sign-in fails with `auth/operation-not-allowed`.

### 2. Authorise the domains the site is served from

**Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains.** Add every origin the site runs on:

```
scaleropensourcelabs.com
osc-website-610b9.web.app        ← usually there already
localhost                        ← for local development
```

Miss this and sign-in fails with `auth/unauthorized-domain`. The site says so explicitly
rather than showing a generic error, because it is the one configuration mistake here that
looks exactly like a code bug.

> **Why Google sign-in and not email + password.** With a password form, anybody could
> register `principal@sst.scaler.com` without owning it — and the address is the only thing
> the club uses to decide who is a member, so an unverified one is worthless. Google
> sign-in proves the person controls the mailbox. The domain is enforced in
> `firestore.rules`, which also requires `email_verified`, so enabling a password provider
> later cannot quietly open that hole.

### 3. Make somebody an organiser

Admins are members of the `admins` collection, keyed by **lowercase email**. No client can
write it — not even an admin — so it is managed by hand:

**Firestore → Data → Start collection** → collection id `admins` → document id
`someone@sst.scaler.com` → add any field (e.g. `added_by: "console"`). The document only
has to exist.

Keying by email rather than uid means you can add an organiser **before** they have ever
signed in. They see a link to the organisers' dashboard on `/dashboard` and can open
`/admin`.

To remove an organiser, delete their document. Do not add a `write` rule to this
collection: denying it is what stops a compromised admin session appointing more admins.

### 4. Publish the first mentor

Until one mentor exists, the mentorship card on every member's dashboard says enrolment
has not opened — which is true, and better than a button that cannot work. So an organiser
has to publish one before the cohort can start.

**`/admin` → Mentors → Add a mentor.** Name, description, programme; organisation, GitHub
and email are optional. The description is the field that matters: it is what a student
reads before choosing, so write what the mentor works on and what they are *not* the
person to ask, not an adjective about them.

Retiring a mentor is **Hide from members**, not Delete. Hiding takes them out of the
picker while every preference already recorded against them still shows their name;
deleting is only offered for a mentor nobody has picked, because a deleted mentor with a
preference pointing at them leaves an id where a name should be.

---

## Reading the data

**Everything is on `/admin`**, which is where an organiser should be looking: the
membership with its breakdowns, the mentor list, who enrolled and which mentors they
asked for. It is served by the `list` rules on `users` and `enrollments`, which only an
address in `admins` satisfies — the page itself is not the gate, and it ships to anybody
who asks for the URL.

For anything the dashboard does not show, **Firestore → Data** in the console. Console
access is governed by who has permissions on the Firebase *project* — **Project settings →
Users and permissions** — which is a separate list from `admins` and a much more powerful
one. Somebody who only needs the roster belongs in `admins`, not in the project.

Nothing turns a preference into an allocation. The dashboard shows demand per mentor and
who asked for whom; pairing the cohort is still a decision somebody makes.

### The document shape

One document per member at `users/{uid}`, where `{uid}` is the Firebase Auth uid:

```js
users/l8JdTxxca59NYDtbsrhTGdF0iKLE {
  uid          "l8JdTxx..."                        // same as the document id
  email        "asha.23bcs10045@sst.scaler.com"    // pinned to the signed-in address
  name         "Asha Verma"
  hostel       "uniworld-1"                        // closed set
  github       "asha"                              // optional, omitted when blank
  path         "program-track"                     // optional, closed set — see below
  created_at   <server timestamp>                  // written once, frozen by the rules
  updated_at   <server timestamp>                  // moves on every save
}
```

Three fields are asked for; the rest is either identity or carried in. **There is no
`year_branch`, `level` or `programs`** — those were removed, and the rules reject a
document that still carries them. Batch, branch and year come from the address
(`23bcs10045` → 2023–27, BCS, roll 10045). Experience level and programme interest were
self-assessments made before somebody had met the club, that nothing acted on; interest is
now expressed by *enrolling*, which is a decision with a consequence.

`path` is the one field nobody is asked for. Every closing action on the site links to
`/join?path=<id>`; the value rides through sign-in and both redirects in the query string
and is saved silently, then shown back on the dashboard where it can be changed or
cleared. It is optional because most members arrive through the nav button with no path
at all.

```js
mentors/61SsdoQwMgUKoXo5HxsZ {          // auto-generated id
  name         "Priya Nair"
  description  "Kubernetes and Go. Good on proposal structure; not for frontend."
  programme    "gsoc"                   // closed set, same list as PROGRAMS
  org          "CNCF"                   // optional
  github       "priya"                  // optional
  email        "…"                      // optional
  active       true                     // false hides them from the picker
  created_at   <server timestamp>
  updated_at   <server timestamp>
}

enrollments/l8JdTxxca59NYDtbsrhTGdF0iKLE {   // keyed by uid, like a profile
  uid          "l8JdTxx..."
  email        "asha.23bcs10045@sst.scaler.com"
  programme    "gsoc"
  mentor_1     "61SsdoQ..."             // must name a mentor that EXISTS
  mentor_2     "mentor-arjun"           // absent exactly when first_only is true
  first_only   false
  created_at   <server timestamp>
  updated_at   <server timestamp>
}
```

**Exactly one of `mentor_2` and `first_only: true`, always, enforced in both directions.**
A document carrying both is contradictory; one carrying neither stores an unanswered
question as though it were an answer, and an organiser pairing thirty students needs to
tell "I only want Priya" apart from "I have not decided". Both mentor ids must reference a
document that exists, which costs one read per write and is what stops the interest list
displaying a raw id where a name should be.

Members may **delete their own enrolment**, which profiles deliberately forbid: a profile
is the club's roster and losing one loses a member, whereas an enrolment is an expression
of interest and withdrawing it is the member's own decision. Admins can read every
enrolment and change none.

**Not JSON files** — Firestore documents, which are JSON-*like* with typed fields
(string, number, boolean, array, map, timestamp). They look like JSON in the console and
export as JSON, but they are rows in a real database with per-field security.

Keyed on the uid rather than storing it as a field, which buys two things: the ownership
rule is a comparison (`request.auth.uid == uid`) rather than a query, and a second profile
for the same person is impossible by construction.

`created_at` is frozen on edit, so "member since" is trustworthy. `email` and `uid` are
frozen too — a member cannot re-file their profile under somebody else's address.

Optional fields are **omitted rather than stored empty**, so an absent `github`
unambiguously means "not given".

### Capacity

For a few hundred members this sits inside the free Spark plan with room to spare:

| | Free limit | 300 members |
|---|---|---|
| Auth accounts | unlimited | 300 |
| Storage | 1 GiB | ~600 KB |
| Reads/day | 50,000 | a few hundred |
| Writes/day | 20,000 | a few hundred |

The dashboard does one read per member per load, unpaginated, which is deliberate at this
scale. Past a few thousand members that needs revisiting.

---

## Changing the form

**`firestore.rules` hardcodes the allowed values for `hostel`, `path` and `programme`,
because Firestore rules cannot import anything.** They are a second copy of the lists in
`web/content/join.ts`.

If you add a hostel, a path or a programme, **you must update both files.** Otherwise
every applicant who picks the new option gets a permission error on submit — the form
looks perfect, the page renders correctly, and only that one option is broken.

`programme` is written **twice** in the rules — once for a mentor and once for an
enrolment — and both copies have to match `PROGRAMS`. Update one and not the other and an
organiser can publish a mentor that no member is then allowed to choose. `npm run rules`
checks both.

This is not hypothetical: two of the five values were wrong when this was first
written (`some` for `some-git`, `hackathon` for `build-day`). So there is a check:

```bash
cd web && npm run rules
```

It diffs the two files and asserts the create-only boundary is still closed. It runs
in CI, needs no Firebase project and no network. Nothing else in the repo would catch
this drift — the smoke test submits no applications and the QA sweep reads pixels.

**If you widen the rules, this check is also what fails when someone denies `read` no
longer.** That is intentional.

---

## Adding another form

The rules close **every** path except `applications`, so a second form does not
half-work — it is denied outright with `Missing or insufficient permissions`. That is
deliberate: a new collection inheriting write access by accident is how a project gets
an open document store.

To add one — say a mentor nomination form:

**1. Add a validated block to `firestore.rules`.** Copy the `applications` block and
its validator; do not widen the existing one. The four lines that must survive the copy:

```
allow read: if false;              // nobody reads through a client
allow update, delete: if false;    // immutable once submitted
allow create: if isWellFormedNomination(request.resource.data);
```

Keep `hasOnly` on the field list, keep the length limits, and keep
`submitted_at == request.time`. Without `hasOnly` a submitter can append arbitrary
keys; without the limits, one request can write a megabyte.

**2. Name the collection in one place.** Add it beside `APPLICATIONS` in
`web/lib/firebase.ts` and import it. The client and the rules referring to different
strings is a permission error that looks nothing like a typo.

**3. Deploy the rules before shipping the form.** In that order, or the first real
submission fails.

**4. Extend `web/scripts/rules.mjs`.** It currently checks one collection. If the new
form has closed-set options in `web/content/`, add them to the drift check — the whole
reason it exists is that Firestore rules cannot import, so every new duplicated list
is a new thing that can silently disagree.

**5. Tell people what happens to their data,** in the form, next to the submit button.
The join form carries two sentences saying answers go to the organisers and nothing is
published. A form that quietly starts storing personal details is the behaviour this
site criticises elsewhere.

**What not to do:** do not reuse `applications` for a different kind of submission. The
validator pins an exact field set, so a nomination would be rejected by it — and
loosening the validator to accept both shapes means neither is really validated.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| "This form is not connected to anything yet" | No config. One of the six `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` values is missing or empty. Restart the dev server — env changes are not hot-reloaded. |
| Console: `Missing or insufficient permissions` | The rules rejected the write. Either they are not deployed (step 4), or the document failed validation — most likely a `level`/`path`/`hostel`/`interests`/`programs` value the rules do not know. Run `npm run rules`. |
| Button stuck on "Sending…", then a "could not confirm" message after 12s | The SDK could not reach Firestore. Wrong `projectId`, no database created, or offline. `addDoc` does **not** reject when the backend is unreachable — it queues and retries forever — which is why there is a timeout at all. |
| Console: `Refused to connect … Content Security Policy` | The CSP in `web/next.config.js` is missing an origin. It already allows `firestore.googleapis.com`, `*.googleapis.com`, and reCAPTCHA on `google.com`/`gstatic.com`. **This fails silently in every screenshot** — the page renders perfectly and only the submit is dead. |
| Works locally, fails in production | Env vars are not set on the host, or App Check enforcement is on without a site key configured there. |
| Nothing appears in the console's Data tab | Check you are looking at the right project and the `applications` collection. A write to a different collection name is denied by the catch-all, so it would have errored. |

## Do not

- **Loosen `allow read`.** It is `if false` and stated explicitly so that anyone
  opening it up has to delete a line that says `false`, rather than add one that was
  never there. A world-readable `applications` collection publishes every applicant's
  name, email and college.
- **Put a service account key, admin credential, or any secret in `.env.local`,
  `.env.example`, or a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.** They ship to the browser.
- **Commit `.env.local`.** It is gitignored; keep it that way.
- **Add a `hosting` block to `firebase.json`.** The site deploys elsewhere; a second
  target competing with it is a bad afternoon.
- **Run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running.** Unrelated to Firebase but it
  will cost you an hour: they share `web/.next`, so the page keeps returning 200 while
  no JavaScript loads. Recover with `rm -rf web/.next`, restart, and confirm with
  `npm run smoke`.
