// Ask GitHub what one handle has contributed, and reduce the answer to the six values
// the dashboard shows.
//
// SEPARATE FROM index.js SO IT CAN BE TESTED WITHOUT FIREBASE. Everything here is a pure
// function of a fetch response, so test-github.mjs drives it with recorded payloads and
// no emulator, no credentials and no network. The same split as format.js.
//
// THE SEARCH API, NOT THE EVENTS API, and this is the decision the whole file rests on:
//
//   /users/{handle}/events  is the obvious endpoint and is useless here. It returns the
//                           last 90 days AND at most 300 events, so a member who
//                           contributed steadily for two years would show a partial
//                           quarter. It is an activity feed, not a history.
//   /search/issues          answers "every PR this account has ever opened, filtered by
//                           state" in one request, with a total count that does not lie
//                           about the tail. That is exactly the question.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHICH LIMIT IT COSTS AGAINST. GitHub meters search separately from
// everything else, and this file touches both meters:
//
//   /search/issues   THREE requests per member (merged, then open, then issues opened),
//                    against the SEARCH limit — 10 per minute unauthenticated, 30 with a
//                    token. This is the binding constraint, and GAP_MS in index.js is
//                    sized against it: change the number of searches here and that
//                    constant has to move with it, or the sweep starts rate-limiting
//                    itself halfway through the club.
//   /users/{handle}  ONE request per member, against the CORE limit — 60 per hour
//                    unauthenticated, 5,000 with a token. Effectively free with a token
//                    and the first thing to break without one.
//
// So a token is not optional past about fifteen members, and the failure without one
// arrives as a 403 that reads like a permissions problem.
//
// `is:merged` RATHER THAN `is:closed`. A closed PR is one that was rejected or abandoned
// just as often as one that landed, and counting those as contributions would make the
// number flattering and worthless. Open ones are counted separately and labelled as
// what they are: in flight.
