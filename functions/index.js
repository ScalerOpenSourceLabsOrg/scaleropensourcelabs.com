// The club's Cloud Functions. Four of them, in three unrelated jobs:
//
//   emailOnApplication    emails the organisers when a row lands in `applications`.
//   syncContributions     nightly, fetches every member's GitHub pull requests.
//   refreshContributions  the same fetch for one member, on demand from the dashboard.
//   tallyResponses        recounts a poll whenever somebody answers it.
//
// A NOTE ON THE FIRST ONE, because it is easy to read this file and assume it still
// fires. It triggers on `applications/{id}`, which is the LEGACY collection from before
// sign-in existed — nothing writes there any more; the profile at `users/{uid}` replaced
// it. So this function is currently dormant. It is kept rather than deleted because the
// rows already in that collection are still protected by it in the rules, and because
// pointing it at `users/{uid}` is a decision about whether organisers want an email per
// sign-up, not a tidy-up. Whoever makes that decision should change the `document` below
// and check format.js still matches the profile's field list.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// EMAIL THE ORGANISERS WHENEVER SOMEBODY APPLIES.
//
// Triggered by the document being created, NOT by the form. That ordering is the whole
// design: the applicant's submit succeeds or fails on the Firestore write alone, so if
// SMTP is down, the mailbox is full, or this function throws, the application is still
// safely stored and nobody loses their submission. An email failure is an inconvenience
// for the organisers, never a lost applicant.
//
// It also means this cannot be used to confirm delivery to the applicant. It is a
// notification to the club, not a receipt to the student — the form's own success panel
// is the receipt.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS. Outbound network from Cloud Functions requires the Blaze
// (pay-as-you-go) plan. For a student club's application volume the usage sits inside
// the free allowance, but a billing account must exist on the project. There is no way
// around that: it is Google's restriction on egress, not a choice made here.
//
// CREDENTIALS. Two secrets, held in Google Secret Manager via defineSecret and never in
// this repo, never in .env, and never in a NEXT_PUBLIC_ variable:
//
//   firebase functions:secrets:set SMTP_URL
//   firebase functions:secrets:set MAIL_TO
//
// SMTP_URL is a connection string, which keeps this provider-agnostic — Gmail with an
// app password, the domain's own mailbox, SendGrid, Mailgun, Resend, anything that
// speaks SMTP. Chosen over a provider SDK deliberately: the club should not have to
// migrate this function if it changes email host.
//
//   smtps://user%40example.com:app-password@smtp.gmail.com:465
//
// The username and password must be URL-encoded — an @ in the username or a / in the
// password will otherwise silently truncate the string and the connection fails with a
// confusing auth error.

// GitHub requests an hour PER IP, which on a college network is 60 an hour for the whole
// club; and a count the client writes is a count the client can invent. The Admin SDK
// here bypasses firestore.rules, which is exactly why `contributions/{uid}` is
// `allow write: if false` for every client including its owner.
//
// CREDENTIALS. One optional secret:
//
//   firebase functions:secrets:set GITHUB_TOKEN
//
// A fine-grained personal access token with NO scopes at all is enough — this only reads
// public data, and the token is for the rate limit rather than for access. Without it the
// sweep still runs and simply gets much less far before GitHub refuses; with it, the
// search limit goes from 10 requests a minute to 30.

/** THE CLUB'S LEADERBOARD, AS ONE DOCUMENT.
 *
 *  WHY IT IS DERIVED HERE RATHER THAN QUERIED BY THE CLIENT. `contributions` is
 *  get-only to its owner and list-only to an admin, and that rule is load-bearing: a
 *  member who could list the collection could read every other member's counts
 *  whether or not anything rendered them. A leaderboard needs the ranking, not the
 *  collection, so the Admin SDK computes the ranking and publishes the one document
 *  members are allowed to see. The private collection stays private.
 *
 *  WHAT IS IN IT IS THE WHOLE DISCLOSURE. Name, handle and three counts — nothing
 *  from the profile that a member did not already publish about themselves. Email,
 *  hostel, batch and path are on the same user document and none of them appear here;
 *  whoever adds a field adds it to a page every member of the club can read.
 *
 *  ADMITTED MEMBERS ONLY, not every verified address. Signing in proves somebody
 *  studies here, which was never membership in anything (see `membership` in
 *  web/lib/profile.ts) — and this is the club's board, published to the club. The
 *  read rule in firestore.rules says isClubMember() for the same reason, so the two
 *  halves agree: the people on it are the people who can see it.
 *
 *  AND ONLY PEOPLE WHO GAVE A HANDLE, which is what makes appearing voluntary. There
 *  is no opt-out switch because there is no row to opt out of until a member types a
 *  GitHub username into their own profile; clearing that field removes them from the
 *  next build. If the club ever wants to be on the board without publishing a handle,
 *  that is a real opt-in field and a rules change, not a tweak here.
 *
 *  BUILT BY THE NIGHTLY SWEEP AND NOWHERE ELSE. The obvious addition is to rebuild it
 *  at the end of refreshContributions() so a member who just merged something sees
 *  themselves move — and that is two full collection reads per press of a button with
 *  a ten-minute cooldown, on the one path a member can trigger at will. The board
 *  carries `built_at` and the page says "as of ..." instead, which is both cheaper and
 *  more honest than a number that is fresh for one row and a day old for the rest. */

// WHY A FUNCTION AND NOT A CLIENT-SIDE COUNTER. `tally` is refused to every client by

// supplies is a count the client invented. The obvious alternative, letting a member
// increment a counter as they vote, cannot be made safe in rules: a rule can check that
// the new count is the old count plus one, but it CANNOT check that the increment came
// with an actual vote, so anybody could push a number up without answering anything.
//
// IT RECOMPUTES FROM SCRATCH RATHER THAN INCREMENTING, and that is the decision worth
// defending. Incrementing is O(1) and wrong in three ordinary situations: a member
// changing their answer (decrement the old, increment the new), a retried function
// invocation (double count), and any write that lands while another is in flight. Reading
// every response and counting is O(n) per write, which for a club poll is a few hundred
// documents — and it is ALWAYS right, including after a bug, because it derives the
// answer rather than accumulating it. If the club ever runs a poll with tens of thousands
// of responses, revisit this; at that point a distributed counter is the standard answer.
