// Drive github.js against recorded GitHub payloads.
//
//   node test-github.mjs
//
// NO NETWORK, NO CREDENTIALS, NO EMULATOR — the same bargain as test-format.mjs. Every
// function under test is a pure function of a fetch response, so `fetch` is replaced with
// a stub that returns whatever the case needs. That is what lets this run in CI on a
// checkout with no Firebase project and no GitHub token.
//
// WHAT IS WORTH TESTING HERE, and it is not "does it call the right URL":
//
//   * the handle validator, because it is the one place member-supplied text reaches a
//     URL, and because its regex is easy to get subtly wrong (leading hyphens, doubled
//     hyphens, 40 characters);
//   * "no such account" versus "an account with no pull requests", because they arrive
//     from GitHub looking almost identical and the dashboard has to word them completely
//     differently;
//   * the distinct-repository count, because it is derived rather than returned, and the
//     bug it replaced — counting only the eight rows the dashboard lists — produced a
//     number that looked entirely plausible;
//   * that a rate limit THROWS with a code rather than resolving to zeroes, because a
//     silent zero would overwrite a real member's real counts with nothing.
