//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The rules file hardcodes the allowed values for `level`, `path`
// and `interests`, because Firestore rules cannot import anything. Those lists are a
// copy of web/content/join.ts, and a copy that nothing checks is a copy that drifts.
//
// The failure mode is nasty and asymmetric: if content gains a value the rules do not
// know, every real applicant who picks it gets a permission-denied on submit. The
// form is correct, the page renders perfectly, the screenshot looks right, and only
// that one path is broken. Nothing else in this repo's checks would notice — the
// smoke test submits nothing, and the QA sweep reads pixels.
//
// I wrote two of the five values wrong on the first attempt (`some` for `some-git`,
// `hackathon` for `build-day`), which is the entire argument for this file.
//
// It is a pure text check with no Firebase dependency and no network, so it runs in
// CI whether or not a Firebase project exists.
