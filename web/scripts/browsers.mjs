// unverified. Safari matters most: it is the majority of mobile traffic in India,
// and this design leans on several features with real engine differences.
//
// Each assertion targets a specific feature that could plausibly differ, and every
// one is MEASURED, not inferred from a support table.
//
// UPDATED FOR THE MULTI-PAGE SITE, and the previous version is worth recording as a
// warning: it probed `#hall [role="img"] span` and `#hall h3` on the HOME page and
// asserted `cardGrid === 14`. After the redesign `#hall` does not exist on any route
// and the grid lives on /hall-of-fame — so every one of those selectors returned
// null, the monogram and card-name checks printed "n/a" with a null verdict, and the
// only hard assertion left compared 0 against 14. A cross-engine audit that measures
// nothing while printing a tidy table is worse than no audit, because it is trusted.
// Selectors that can go stale are now paired with the route that owns them, and the
// card count is derived rather than hardcoded to a number from a scaffold array.

// That is why CI points this suite at `next dev`, which omits the directive
// deliberately; all three engines pass there. Detected and explained here rather than
// left as a mystery, because the signature looks like catastrophic breakage and costs
// an hour to re-derive. Verified: dev sends the directive 0 times, production sends it.
