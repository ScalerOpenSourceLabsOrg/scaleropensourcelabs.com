// .env.local needs exactly this to point at the emulator — the values are fake on purpose,

// cannot touch the club's actual data:

//   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-osc
//   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=demo-osc.firebaseapp.com
//   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=demo-key-for-emulator

//
// scripts/smoke.mjs runs signed out, so it can only assert that /join shows the sign-in
// step and keeps its query string. scripts/rules-emulator.mjs executes the rules with
// forged tokens, so it never touches the UI. Neither can answer the questions that
// actually break this feature:
//
//   * does signInWithPopup work at all under our Content-Security-Policy?
//   * does the profile save, and does the second save (an EDIT) still work?
//   * does ?path= survive the sign-in step AND the two redirects behind it?
//   * does signing in actually land on /onboarding, and finishing it on /dashboard —
//     without either route bouncing the reader back where they came from?
//   * is the batch really read out of the address, and really not stored?
//   * can an organiser publish a mentor from a browser, and can a member then pick one?
//   * is a mentor somebody picked protected from being deleted?
//   * is the dashboard refused to a member and served to an admin?
//   * do its sort, its filters and its refresh actually change what is on screen?
//
// THE REDIRECT QUESTIONS ARE NEW AND ARE THE REASON THIS FILE GREW. The signed-in flow
// used to be one component on one route, which could not be half-redirected. It is three
// routes now, each shipping as static HTML before auth resolves, and the failure mode is
// a loop or a dead stop on a "checking your sign-in" card — neither of which throws, logs
// anything, or looks different from a slow network in a screenshot.
//
// The CSP question is the reason this is worth the machinery. Sign-in needs
// apis.google.com in script-src and the auth domain in frame-src, and when either is
// missing the page renders perfectly, the button is present, the click does nothing, and
// the only trace is a violation in a console nobody has open. That is exactly the failure
// shape that reaches production.
//
// TWO THINGS ABOUT DRIVING THE EMULATOR'S POPUP, both learned the hard way:
//
//   1. Its submit button is Material, and the ripple overlay swallows Playwright's
//      synthetic click — the button reports visible and enabled, the click "succeeds",
//      and nothing happens. A DOM .click() inside evaluate() works.
//   2. Its email field is `#email-input` and is type="text", not type="email", so a
//      [type=email] selector waits forever.
//
// It clears both emulators first. Without that, a second run finds the account already
// registered, the popup offers it to pick instead of showing the add-account form, and
// the suite fails on its own leftovers rather than on the site.

 *
 *  So rather than one way of pressing it, this tries three, rotating per attempt: a DOM
 *  click (which survives the Material ripple overlay that swallows synthetic ones), a real
 *  Playwright click (genuine pointer events, which the DOM click does not produce), and
 *  Enter in the form (submits without needing the button at all).
 *
 *  Retrying is safe: once the popup has gone `isClosed()` is true and the loop stops, and
