// Build the public team page from the core-team roster.
//
//   npm run team:sync            against the local emulator
//   FIRESTORE_TOKEN=... npm run team:sync    against the real project
//
// WHY A BUILD STEP AND NOT A FETCH. The obvious alternative is for /team to read the
// roster in the browser, and it is wrong for one decisive reason: Firestore rules are
// per-DOCUMENT, not per-field. A public page reading `admins` reads whole rows — and the
// document id IS an email — so it would publish every organiser's inbox next to their
// name. Projecting at build time takes only the public fields, and leaves /team
// prerendered and instant rather than turning the club's best-looking page into a
// loading state.
//
// WHAT IT MERGES, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO SOURCES AT ALL:
//
//   Firestore `admins`          WHO is on the team. Live, owner-edited, and the same row
//                               that grants access — so the page and the access list
//                               cannot disagree, which is the drift this whole exercise
//                               is about.
//   content/team-editorial.ts   WHAT the page says about them. Reviewed prose with rules
//                               of its own; see the header of that file.
//
// IT FAILS RATHER THAN GUESSES. An active member with no remit stops the build and is
// named. That is the forcing function that keeps the two steps honest: access is instant,
// publication is reviewed. A script that emitted a bare name instead would make the
// second step optional, and it would stay undone.
//
// NO DEPENDENCIES, DELIBERATELY. It talks to the Firestore REST API with `fetch`, so it
// needs no firebase-admin in web/package.json — this repo must keep building for a
// contributor with no Firebase project at all.
