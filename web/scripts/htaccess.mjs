// Generate out/.htaccess for shared Apache hosting (GoDaddy, cPanel).
//
//   npm run build:static      # runs the export, then this
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. A static export cannot use next.config.js `headers()` or
// `redirects()` — Next says so during the build: "rewrites, redirects, and headers are
// not applied when exporting your application". So on Apache the entire
// Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, nosniff, frame-deny and Permissions-Policy simply
// vanish, and /programs starts 404ing. The site looks identical and is measurably less
// safe, which is the worst kind of regression.
//
// Everything below is generated from lib/security-headers.js, the same module
// next.config.js reads, so the two can never drift. Do not hand-edit out/.htaccess —
// it is rebuilt on every export. Change the module instead.
//
// The production policy is forced regardless of how this script was invoked: a build
// run with NODE_ENV=development must never emit an .htaccess carrying 'unsafe-eval'
// and localhost origins to a live host.
