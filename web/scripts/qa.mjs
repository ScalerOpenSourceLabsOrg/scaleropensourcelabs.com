// This exists because every single time I have actually looked at this site in a
// browser I have found a real bug — a headline overflowing the viewport, a rocket
// rendering behind the copy, a transition that never completed, a card sitting on
// its own subject. None of those were visible in the source.
//
// Mobile and light theme have never once been checked. That is where the defects
// will be.
//
// The automated checks below catch the things a screenshot won't show you:
// horizontal overflow, text smaller than 12px, tap targets under 44px, images
// without alt text, heading levels that skip, and contrast failures against the
// actual computed background.
