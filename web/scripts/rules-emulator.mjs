//
// WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM scripts/rules.mjs. That one is a text check: it diffs
// the rules against the form's option lists and greps for the deny lines. It needs no
// Java, no emulator and no network, so it runs on every CI push.
//
// This one actually EXECUTES the rules, and now it has to, because the model is no
// longer "anyone may create one thing". It is identity-dependent: a member may read
// exactly one document, an admin may query the collection, an off-domain account may do
// nothing, and an unverified address may do nothing even if the domain matches. None of
// that can be checked by reading the file. The interesting failures are all of the form
// "rule looks right, allows the wrong person".
//
// It uses @firebase/rules-unit-testing, which is the only way to forge an auth token —
// signing in for real would need a Google account per test case.
//
// A note on the emulator's output: several denials are logged as "evaluation error"
// rather than a clean `false`. That is expected — when a field is absent or the wrong
// type, expressions like `d.name.size()` raise instead of returning false, and the rules
// engine treats a raised error as a denial. The security outcome is identical; it only
// makes the log noisier. Every verdict below is asserted explicitly.
