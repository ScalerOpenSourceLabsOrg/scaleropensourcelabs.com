// PEOPLE, minus the people content/team.ts and content/selections.ts already own.
//
// This module is what survived a merge between two versions of the site that had
// both grown their own roster. The rule applied throughout was that those lists win
// on anything both files describe, so what is here is strictly the half it did
// not have:
//
//   ALUMNI  — where members went after graduating. Nothing else tracks it; the club
//             records the current team and the selections it produced, and says
//             nothing about what happens to somebody two years later. That is the
//             single most persuasive thing on the site for a parent, and it was
//             about to be lost in the merge.
//
//   ORGS    — the organisations the club has a relationship with, and what kind.
//             Rendered as the representation wall.
//
// NOT HERE, and deliberately: the core team (TEAM_OFFICERS / TEAM_LEADS /
// TEAM_SHADOWS in content/team.ts, which carries the shadow structure this file's
// CORE_TEAM did not)
// and the achievers (SELECTIONS in content/selections.ts, which carries the real
// GSoC cohort and
// runs to twenty-five). Import those from their own modules.
//
// THE RULE FOR EVERY FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY still applies: if you cannot open a
// URL that proves it, it does not go in. `consented` on anything naming a real
// person; not true, not rendered.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 2. ALUMNI / PAST CORE MEMBERS.
//
// "Where they are now" is the single most persuasive column on this page for a
// first-year deciding whether any of this leads anywhere — and the one most
// tempting to inflate. Same rule: it is a statement of fact about a real person,
// with their permission, and it should be checkable on their public profile.

// 4. GLOBAL REPRESENTATION.
//
// A LOGO WALL RENDERED AS TYPE, not as images, for the same two reasons the
// projects page gives: these marks are other organisations' trademarks, and the
// site's Content-Security-Policy allows `img-src 'self' data:` only, so a remote
// logo would be blocked and render broken.
//
// A MAP WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED. A world map with dots on it is the obvious
// visual, and it would be the least honest thing on the site: a handful of
// contributions renders as a nearly empty globe, which understates the work, and
// the moment you scale the dots to look respectable you are drawing a picture of
// data you do not have. A named list of organisations with a link each is smaller,
// duller, and checkable.
//
// `relation` is the load-bearing field. "Contributed to" and "works at" are very
// different claims and collapsing them into one wall of names would be the exact
// kind of quiet inflation this file exists to prevent.

 * How many people this club can actually name, deduplicated.

 * That is how a club claims sixty people and has twenty in the room, and it is the
 * single easiest number on this site to inflate by accident rather than intent.
 *

 * right trade here: two different students with the same name would undercount by
 * one, whereas any id-based scheme needs an id maintained by hand across four
 * arrays and silently overcounts the moment somebody forgets.
