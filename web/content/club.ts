// SELECTIONS — the club's strongest claim.
//
// Getting students into GSoC, LFX Mentorship, C4GT and Summer of Bitcoin is the
// most internationally legible thing a college open-source club can show. These
// programmes are recognised on sight by exactly the audience this site is for, and
// unlike a self-reported metric they cannot be manufactured: somebody else ran a
// selection process and picked your member.
//
// Two rules, both non-negotiable.
//
// 1. CONSENT. Each entry publishes a real student's face and name to an
//    international audience. That needs their explicit permission, and `consented`
//    must be true or the entry does not render — the same rule the old dashboard
//    enforced in the database, applied here in the content file.
//
// 2. NO PROGRAMME LOGOS. We render the programme NAME as type, never the official
//    GSoC/Linux Foundation/C4GT mark. Those are trademarks belonging to other
//    organisations, and putting them on a club site implies an endorsement nobody
//    granted. Typographic treatment says the same thing and is ours to use.

// GSSOC AND HACKTOBERFEST ARRIVED IN THE MERGE, and they are the reason the `tier`
// field below exists. This list used to be five programmes that a student has to be
// SELECTED into, which made "programme" and "paid, competitive thing" the same word.
// The moment two open-entry events joined the list that stopped being true, and a
// first-year reading a single undifferentiated grid would reasonably conclude that
// every item on it is out of reach this year. The honest answer — the open ones
// today, the paid ones after a few months of the open ones — needs the distinction
// to be in the data.

 * is the floor band and legal ONLY with secondary encoding, so every planet also
 * carries its programme name as a direct label. Colour never carries identity
 * alone here.
 *
 * The obvious palette — Google blue for GSoC next to a violet for LFX — failed
 * badly: ΔE 2.5 under protanopia, effectively one colour for a red-green
 * colourblind viewer. Blue and violet are adjacent hues; magenta buys the
 * separation that violet cannot.
 */
/* Programme colours resolve through CSS custom properties rather than literals,
   because the same hue cannot serve both themes: the dark set was validated
   against #05070D and measures 3.22–3.83:1 on white, i.e. all four fail AA as
   the 11px text they are used for. The variables are defined per theme in

   theme. */
/* THE LAST TWO WERE ADDED BY A MERGE AND WERE PUT THROUGH THE SAME VALIDATOR.
   `npm run palette -- --legacy` sweeps all seven, and the seven-colour set fails on
   exactly the pairs the five-colour set already failed on — three GSOC/OUTREACHY
   distances, which are the known adjacent-hue problem the note above describes.
   Adding these two costs nothing.

   Getting there took three attempts and the reason is worth recording, because the
   obvious pick is the wrong one. GSSoC's own branding is pink, and a pink sits on
   top of LFX's magenta: dE 13.8 against a floor of 15. Moving it to a mid red then
   collided with SOB's orange under deuteranopia and with C4GT's teal under
   protanopia — because red-green CVD collapses all three of those onto the same
   axis, so no amount of hue-shifting inside the red-orange-green arc separates
   them. The only two things that survive red-green CVD are the blue-yellow axis and
   LIGHTNESS, which is why GSSoC ended up as a very dark red on light and a very
   light pink on dark rather than as anything in the middle.

   Colour still never carries identity alone here — every programme is directly
   labelled with its own name — but the set is no longer weaker than the one it
   extends. Re-run the sweep before adding an eighth. */

// POSITIONING against the other club a student is choosing between.
//
// EVERY NUMBER HERE IS VERIFIED AGAINST A PRIMARY SOURCE AND CARRIES ITS LINK.
// That is not fussiness — this section attacks a rival activity, so it is the
// first place a sceptical reader will go looking for an exaggeration. One
// unsupported figure here retroactively discredits every other claim on a site
// whose whole thesis is "you can check this".
//
// Two claims were CUT during research because they did not hold up:
//   * "only ~9 people per college make ICPC" — no rule or dataset produces 9.
//     The real numbers (3 by rule, ~5.6 in practice, 30 nationally) are both
//     true and more striking, so the invented figure bought nothing.
//   * "open source is an easier door than ICPC" — false. GSoC 2025 accepted
//     1,280 of 15,240 applicants, about 8.4%. Comparable brutality.
//
// So the argument is deliberately NOT "our thing is easier to win". It is that
// open source pays out below the top prize and competitive programming mostly
// does not. That is the floor, not the ceiling, and it is defensible.
//
// THE THIRD COLUMN. A student on this campus is realistically choosing between
// three clubs, not two, so the AI/ML club is in the comparison rather than
// implied. It carries NO FIGURES, and that is deliberate: there is no rulebook
// to cite for a hackathon and no published national admit rate for a Kaggle
// competition, so every AI/ML cell is a structural statement about how the
// activity works — open entry, a fixed prize pool, a leaderboard that closes —
// which is checkable by anyone who has entered one. Inventing a stat to fill
// the column would break the same rule the two claims above were cut for.
//
// Each row is also written so the CP and AI/ML cells are ones their own members
// would agree with. "Who signs off" concedes the judge outright. A comparison a
// rival would call unfair is one a reader discounts entirely, and this section
// only works if it survives being read by someone in both other clubs.

// adjectives describing the person. Recency and a checkable record are the honest
// basis of a senior's authority, and they are enough.

// THE TEAM — who actually runs the club.

// This list used to be org structure and NOTHING else — a team entry claimed only
// the office, on the grounds that a mentor's entry is backed by a public artifact
// and an officer's is backed by holding the office. That rule has been relaxed
// deliberately, so the reasoning that replaced it is worth writing down:
//
//   A `remit` says what the office covers, and stays true across a handover.
//   A `highlights` list says what the PERSON has done, and does not.
//
// Both now render, and the second one is the one to be careful with. These are
// claims about named students, so the file's own rule still binds them: if you
// cannot open a URL that proves it, it does not go in, and nothing goes in without
// that person's say-so. A batch year and an internship are checkable; a superlative
// is not. When somebody hands over, their highlights leave with them — only the
// remit is inherited by whoever takes the office.
//
// Three tiers, because the club genuinely has three: the two officers, the three
// functional leads, and the shadows. A shadow is an understudy attached to one
// specific role who is being trained to take it over at handover — which is the
// only reason a student club survives its founders graduating, and therefore worth
// showing on the chart rather than hiding in a handbook.
//
// Plus the desks (TEAM_CONTENT, at the bottom of this section): several people
// doing one job together under a lead, which is a different shape from both a tier
// and a shadow and gets its own type rather than being flattened into either.
//
// `shadowOf` holds the DESIGNATION, not the person. Roles outlast the people in
// them: when Rushab hands over, the shadow relationship should not need re-pointing
// at a new name. Team.tsx resolves it against the tier above and positions the
// card in that role's column, so a typo here surfaces as a missing connector
// rather than a silently wrong one.

/* Tier 3, the other kind. A DESK, not an understudy — and that difference is why
   this is a group with one remit rather than four TeamMembers with four.
   A shadow is attached to a role and is training to hold it; a desk is several
   people doing the same work together, and nobody on it holds an office. Giving
   each member a `designation` would invent four titles the club does not award,
   and giving each its own `remit` would repeat one sentence four times. So the
   remit sits on the desk, where it is true.

   Its members may still carry a batch and their own highlights, because those
   belong to the person rather than to the desk — the remit answers "what does this
   desk do", and a highlight answers "who is this". A desk member with neither is
   just a name, which is a complete entry here.

   `of` is a DESIGNATION for the same reason `shadowOf` is: the desk reports to the
   Repo Maintainer's office, not to whoever currently holds it. Team.tsx resolves
   it against the leads and drops the connector from that column. */
