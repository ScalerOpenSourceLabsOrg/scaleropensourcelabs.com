//
// One job: a first-year who has never opened a pull request should finish this page
// knowing what open source is, why it changes what happens after graduation, and
// what to do today. In that order, because the third does not land without the
// first two.
//
// The register is seniors explaining something they actually did, not a
// prospectus. Concretely, from CONTRIBUTING.md: say what happened rather than how
// it felt, no adjectives describing people, sentence case, and prefer the specific.

// 1. WHAT OPEN SOURCE ACTUALLY IS.
//
// The strongest available argument is not a definition, it is the reader's own
// laptop: they are already running several of these and did not know. So every
// entry is something a student at this college is overwhelmingly likely to have
// open right now, and every one links to the actual source repository — the point
// being that you can go and read it, which is the whole idea.
//
// The VS Code entry states the licensing nuance rather than smoothing it over.
// "VS Code is open source" is the kind of half-true line that a maintainer reading
// this page would notice immediately, and getting it exactly right costs one clause.

//
// Added to pull the page toward open source itself and away from being a career
// pitch with open source as the mechanism. The section above tells a reader that the
// software they use is public; this tells them who is on the other side of it, which
// is the part that makes contributing feel like joining something rather than
// harvesting something.
//
// It is also the honest counterweight to the page that follows. "Your GitHub becomes
// your resume" is true and it is not why any of this exists, and a site that only
// ever makes the career argument produces exactly the contributor maintainers
// complain about — one who opens four pull requests in October and is never seen
// again.
//
// No numbers here, deliberately. The obvious version cites how few people maintain
// some critical package, and every figure I could recall for that is either dated or
// unverifiable from memory. The repo rule applies: a weaker claim you can prove beats
// a stronger one you cannot. So the claim is about a study that exists and what it
// was for, which the link supports exactly.

// 1c. THE VOCABULARY.
//
// This is the most open-source-specific thing on the site and it is here because the
// barrier to a first contribution is very often linguistic rather than technical. A
// second-year who can write Python fine will still not open a pull request when the
// contributing guide says "rebase onto upstream/main and squash before we triage" —
// and nobody explains those words, because everyone who could has forgotten not
// knowing them.
//
// Chosen by one test: would a competent second-year who has never contributed be
// stopped by this word? "Repository" and "commit" are out — they have used those.
// "Upstream", "nit" and "LGTM" are in, because they are used constantly, never
// explained, and each one privately reads as hostile the first time.

//   * "only ~9 people per college make ICPC" — no rule or dataset produces 9. The
//     real numbers (3 by rule, 30 nationally) are both true and more striking.
//   * "open source is an easier door than ICPC" — false. GSoC 2025 accepted 1,280
//     of 15,240 applicants, about 8.4%. Comparable brutality.
//
// So the argument is deliberately NOT "our thing is easier to win". It is that
// open source pays out below the top prize and competitive programming mostly does
// not. That is a claim about the floor, not the ceiling, and it is defensible.

// stories to six where one says "it was a great learning experience".
//
// `consented` is not optional and not a formality: this publishes a named student's
// own words to an international audience. Set it only after they have read the exact
// text that will ship.
