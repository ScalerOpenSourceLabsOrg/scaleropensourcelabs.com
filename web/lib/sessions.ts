// When the club actually meets.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A NOTICE. The board and this collection look similar enough that the
// club ran sessions as pinned notices for a while, and it failed in two ways that a
// second field could not fix:
//
//   * a notice has no time, only a posting date, so "Saturday, 4pm, Lab 2" lived in the
//     body as prose and nothing could sort or filter on it; and
//   * a notice never stops being current, so last week's session sat above this week's
//     until somebody remembered to unpin it.
//
// A session has a `starts_at`, so the only two questions anyone asks of it — what is next,
// and has it happened — are answered by the data rather than by whoever is reading.
//
// `starts_at` IS THE ONE DATE IN THIS APP THAT IS NOT SERVER-STAMPED, and the rules make
// that explicit. Every other timestamp is pinned to `request.time` so a client cannot
// backdate a record; this one is chosen by the organiser and is nearly always in the
// future, so the same rule would make scheduling impossible.
