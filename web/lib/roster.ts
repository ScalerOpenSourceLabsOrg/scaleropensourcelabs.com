// The core-team roster: who runs the club, and what that entitles them to.
//
// ONE ROW PER PERSON, KEYED BY EMAIL, holding BOTH halves of "core team":
//
//   the access grant   role + active, which firestore.rules reads on every request
//   the public billing name + title + photo, which the /team page shows
//
// THEY ARE ONE ROW BECAUSE THEY WERE TWO LISTS AND THE TWO LISTS DRIFTED. The club kept
// its team in `content/team.ts` (a commit and a deploy) and its access in `admins` (a
// console edit), and nothing connected them — so the failure was silent in both
// directions: somebody who left still had admin, or a new lead could not get in but
// appeared on the site. A club whose team turns over yearly cannot maintain that.
//
// KEYED BY EMAIL RATHER THAN uid, which is the decision that makes churn cheap: an
// organiser can be added BEFORE they have ever signed in. With uid keys you would have
// to make them sign in, read their uid out of the Auth tab, and only then grant access.
// For a club adding people monthly that is a bad first day, every month.
//
// RETIRING IS `active: false`, NEVER A DELETE — the rules refuse deletes outright. It
// revokes just as fast (the rules read the field on every request) and keeps the record
// of who ran the club when, which is the thing a handover actually needs.
//
// WHY THE PUBLIC HALF DOES NOT REACH /team FROM HERE. Firestore rules are per-DOCUMENT,
// not per-field: a public page reading this collection would read whole rows, and the
// document id IS an email — so it would publish every organiser's inbox alongside their
// name. The public page is generated from these rows at BUILD time instead, by
// scripts/team-roster.mjs, which takes only the public fields.
