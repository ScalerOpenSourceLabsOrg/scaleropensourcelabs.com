// Sign-in, held in one context so every component agrees about who is signed in.
//
// GOOGLE SIGN-IN ONLY, AND RESTRICTED TO ONE DOMAIN. Email-and-password was the
// obvious alternative and was rejected for a specific reason rather than on taste: with
// a password form, anybody can register `principal@sst.scaler.com` without owning it.
// The address is the only thing this club uses to decide who is a member, so an
// unverified one is worthless. Google sign-in proves the person controls the mailbox,
// and everybody on that domain already has the account, so it is also the shorter path
// for them — one tap, no password to invent, no reset flow to build and support.
//
// THE DOMAIN IS CHECKED THREE TIMES, and only the third is security:
//
//   1. `hd` on the provider — a HINT to Google's account chooser. It filters the
//      picker; it does NOT stop a determined person choosing another account, which is
//      exactly why the other two exist. Treating `hd` as enforcement is the classic
//      mistake here.
//   2. signOut() below, immediately, if the address that came back is not on the
//      domain. This is a clear error message, not a boundary — a signed-out client can
//      still hold a valid token for a moment.
//   3. firestore.rules, on every read and write. THIS is the boundary. Even with a
//      valid Google account on another domain, the rules refuse to store or return
//      anything. Read that file if you are reviewing whether this is safe.
//
// The whole thing is client-side, because the site is a static export with no server.
// That means route-gating is cosmetic — someone can always fetch the HTML for /profile
// or /admin — and it is fine ONLY because the data is protected by rules rather than by
// hiding pages. Do not add a "protected route" and conclude the data is safe.
