// Mentorship: the mentors an organiser publishes, and the preferences a member records
// against them. Two collections, one feature, one module.
//
// NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH components/Mentors.tsx AND `MENTORS` IN content/club.ts. Those
// are a PUBLIC MARKETING section — hard-coded, consent-gated, rendered to anybody reading
// the site, and currently empty. This is the private, signed-in machinery the club runs
// its GSoC cohort with. The two will look similar in a file listing and have nothing to do
// with each other; if they ever need to share data, it is the marketing page that should
// read from here, never the reverse, because a mentor consenting to run office hours is
// not the same as consenting to be named on a public web page.
//
// WHY PREFERENCES AND NOT ASSIGNMENTS. A member records a first choice and either a second
// choice or "first preference only". Nothing here turns that into an allocation: no
// capacity, no approval queue, no confirmed-mentor field. That is a deliberate stopping
// point rather than an unfinished one — pairing thirty students with six mentors is a
// conversation an organiser has once a term with the whole picture in front of them, and a
// half-built approval workflow would be a queue somebody has to staff for no gain. The
// dashboard gives them the picture; the pairing stays a human decision.
//
// ONE READ PER COLLECTION PER DASHBOARD LOAD, unpaginated, for the same reason as
// readAllProfiles: a few hundred documents against a 50,000-a-day free quota.
