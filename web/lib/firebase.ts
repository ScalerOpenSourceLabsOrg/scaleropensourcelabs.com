// Firebase, initialised lazily and only when it is actually configured.
//
// WHY THE NEXT_PUBLIC_ KEYS ARE NOT A LEAK. A Firebase web config is an identifier,
// not a credential — it names the project so the SDK knows where to send requests.
// Google documents it as publishable, and it is inlined into the bundle by design.
// The security boundary is firestore.rules, which is the file worth reviewing
// carefully. Anyone reading this and reaching for a server-side proxy to "hide" the
// key would be hiding a public identifier and still relying on the same rules.
//
// EVERYTHING RETURNS null WHEN UNCONFIGURED, and that is load-bearing rather than
// defensive. This repo has no credentials committed and the site must keep building,
// rendering and passing its checks with no .env.local at all — a contributor fixing
// a typo should not have to stand up a Firebase project. So the absence of config is
// a supported state, not an error: `getDb()` returns null, and the join form tells
// the reader plainly that it is not wired up instead of pretending to submit. That
// honest-failure path already existed for the old POST endpoint and is preserved.
//
// The import is dynamic for a second reason: the Firebase SDK is ~200KB, and a
// static import would put it in the bundle of every route including the five that
// have no form. Loading it inside the submit handler means a reader who never
// submits never downloads it.
