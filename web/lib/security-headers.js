// next.config.js serves them through `headers()`, which covers `next dev` and any
// Next-aware host. But a STATIC EXPORT cannot use `headers()` at all — Next says so
// itself during the build: "rewrites, redirects, and headers are not applied when
// exporting your application". On shared Apache hosting (GoDaddy, cPanel) they have to
// be re-declared in .htaccess instead, which scripts/htaccess.mjs generates.
//
// So there are two consumers, and a copy of a Content-Security-Policy that nothing
// keeps in sync is a copy that rots — the version in .htaccess would silently stay on
// last month's policy while the Next one moved, and the difference would only show up
// as a form that works locally and not in production. This module is the single source
// both read.
//
// Plain CommonJS with no imports so next.config.js (CJS) and an ESM build script can
// both consume it without a bundler.
