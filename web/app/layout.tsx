// TWO faces, where there were four. Both self-hosted at build time by next/font,
// so there is no third-party request and no layout shift.
//
// This replaces a trio — Anton for display, Staatliches for labels and buttons,
// Poppins for body — that was read off notyourcollege.com and built for a poster
// register: heavy, condensed, all-caps, shouting. The audience for this page is
// sixteen and seventeen year olds deciding whether this club is for them, and a
// poster shouts AT that reader rather than talking to them.
//
// Plus Jakarta Sans does all three jobs. It is the modern humanist geometric the
// brief asks for — rounder and warmer than Inter, cleaner and less bubbly than
// Poppins — and crucially it ships 200-800, so display, label and body are
// weights of ONE family rather than three families pretending to agree. The
// aliasing that points --font-display and --font-label at it lives in
// globals.css, next to the note about what that costs (every display usage now
// has to state its own weight).

});

// THE DISPLAY FACE. Headlines only — the hero, every section heading, the big
// figures. Body, labels and buttons stay on Plus Jakarta Sans above.
//
// SPACE GROTESK, replacing Syne — cool and legible, in that order of difficulty.
//
// Syne had the personality and paid for it in reading. Its ascenders and
// descenders are unusually long, so at 800 a two-line heading fused into one dark
// block: the descender of "picked" landed in the cap-height of the line below it.
// The evidence that this was a real problem and not a preference is in
// tailwind.config.ts — EVERY step of the type scale had to be loosened to
// accommodate one face. When a typeface forces the whole vertical rhythm to move,
// the typeface is the thing that is wrong.
//
// Space Grotesk keeps the character and gives the space back. It is still
// distinctly not-neutral — the flat-sided round forms, the single-storey 'a' at
// display size, the squared terminals — and it is the face this audience already
// reads as "developer", which is the register the whole page is in. But its
// extenders are short, its counters are open, and its x-height is large, which is
// most of what legibility is at small sizes and all of what it is at large ones.
//
// Impact and Bebas Neue stay rejected for the reasons below, unchanged:
//
//   * IMPACT is a system font. It is not on the web, it is absent from most
//     Android and many Linux installs, and next/font cannot self-host it — a
//     headline set in it would be Impact on some machines and whatever Helvetica
//     the fallback stack lands on elsewhere. A display face that renders
//     differently per visitor is not a display face.
//
//   * BEBAS NEUE HAS NO LOWERCASE. Every heading it touches becomes capitals,
//     and this page's section headings are two-clause sentences — "Most students
//     never apply because nobody told them these exist." An earlier pass on this
//     site already had to remove all-caps headings for exactly this reason: at
//     display size they ran to three full lines of capitals and read as a wall.
//
// 700 IS THE CEILING, and it is why every display call site moved from
// `font-extrabold` to `font-bold` in the same change. Space Grotesk ships
// 300–700; an element asking for 800 gets the 700 master plus SYNTHETIC
// emboldening, which smears an already-heavy face. Asking for what exists is the
// difference between a bold headline and a blurry one.

            The nav, the scroll reveals and the four-column footer used to live here, so
            every route inherited them — including /dashboard, where a member who joined
            last month was still being shown a bar arguing the case for joining. They now
            live in app/(site)/layout.tsx, and the signed-in routes get their own shell
            from app/(app)/layout.tsx. Route groups, so no URL changed and the decision is
            made at build time rather than after hydration.

            What is left here is what genuinely IS shared: the document, the fonts, the
            anti-flash script, the skip link and the auth context.

            AuthProvider wraps the whole document rather than one group, because the site
            nav reads it too — signed in, its one button changes. It costs nothing on the
            routes that do not care: firebase/auth is dynamically imported inside the
            provider, so a reader who never signs in never downloads it, and with no
            Firebase config the provider resolves immediately to "signed out" and renders
            no extra markup. */}
