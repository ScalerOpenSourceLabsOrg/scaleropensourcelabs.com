// PATH and PATHS are both here and are not the same thing, which is worth stating

// every first contribution goes through, in order — a sequence. PATHS (join.ts) is
// the set of named entry routes a person can pick from, split by level, and it is
// what the join form's preselect is derived from. The page renders the choice
// first and the sequence second, because "which of these am I" comes before "what
// happens then".
import { LEVEL_LABEL, PATHS, type Level } from "@/content/join";

// The two level groups the paths are rendered in, in order.
//
// NOT `LEVELS` from join.ts, and the near-miss is worth naming: that export is the
// join form's experience dropdown — "Never contributed", "Some Git experience",
// "I have merged pull requests" — which is a different question with three answers
// rather than this one with two. Importing it here typechecks as an array and
// renders two sections titled after form options. Hence the explicit local name.
const PATH_LEVELS: Level[] = ["beginner", "intermediate"];

// HOW TO JOIN. Everything a student needs to have read before the form.
//
// THE ORDER IS A SEQUENCE OF OBJECTIONS, answered in the order they occur:
//
//   looking-for   "they must already be brilliant"      — no, here is the bar
//   path          "I would not know where to start"     — four steps, named
//   Banner        (the stop where that argument lands)
//   culture       "what is it actually like"            — Maggi and arguing
//   who-not-for   "is this a waste of my time"          — four honest reasons to leave
//   faq           everything left over
//
// The deterrent section leading is not an accident of layout. A grid of students
// selected into international programmes — which is what a reader arrives here
// from — is simultaneously this club's strongest claim and its biggest deterrent,
// and the private thought it produces is "I could never". That gets answered
// first, at the moment it occurs, rather than in an FAQ nobody scrolls to.
//
// WHO-NOT-FOR STAYS. Four reasons to walk away, on the page whose entire job is
// recruitment, is the section every instinct says to cut — and it is the one that
// makes the rest credible. A page that claims a club is for everybody is a page
// making a claim nobody believes.

            patch gets merged — and it is{" "}

          </p>

          {/* A contrast rather than a list. "We value reasoning" alone is the kind
              of thing every club says; setting each value against the credential it
              replaces is what makes it specific enough to be believed.

              TWO CARDS, where this used to be one stack of paired rows. The pairing
              is still real — index i on the left is the credential index i on the
              right replaces — but it is now carried by ORDER rather than by
              adjacency, which is the one thing this layout gives up. What it buys
              is that each side reads as a single position you can take in at a
              glance, and that the right-hand card can be visibly the answer: it is
              the one with the border, the tint and the weight.

              Both lists are rendered from the same array in the same order, so they
              cannot drift; if a future entry breaks the correspondence, it breaks
              in the content file rather than here.

              ORDER is only half of it, though. The right-hand lines set two deep
              and the left-hand ones set one, so left row 3 was drifting a whole
              line above its own replacement — the correspondence was true but
              unreadable. So the rows are pinned instead of flowed: both cards are
              grid items in one row and therefore already equal height, each card
              is a column that hands its leftover height to the list, and each list
              divides that height into N equal tracks. Pair i then begins at the
              same y on both sides no matter how either line wraps.

              The track count comes off the array rather than being written out, so
              a fifth pair cannot silently land in a four-row grid. */}
          {/* Its own group rather than one more child of the section's: the pair
              sits a screen below the heading that introduces it, and on the
              section's trigger both cards would have finished arriving before
              anybody scrolled far enough to see either. */}

                quieter card — no lift, everything struck through. It is here to be
                dismissed and it should look dismissed.

                The tints are 4%/6% washes rather than the soft pastels the brief
                sketches, because these are large fills behind long paragraphs. At
                the strength a badge wants, a full card of red reads as an error
                state — and the whole point of the copy inside is that having a
                contest rating is not a failure, it is simply the wrong measure.
                The border carries the colour instead; the fill only has to keep

              width from 1280 up, including 1920 — it claimed to be "taped to the
              left gutter" while sitting almost entirely inside the content
              column, because its offset was a 24px nudge rather than the note's
              own width and its gate was `xl:`, which is exactly the width at
              which the gutter is ZERO.

              None of the automated checks can catch that. Overlap is not
              overflow, not contrast, not a tap target; the QA sweep passed clean
              through every version of the bug. It took looking at the page —
              which is why the arithmetic now lives in Note.tsx, where the next
              note added cannot get it wrong by being written from memory. */}

              run, and setting it in the same face as the sentence around it
              would leave that as a claim instead of a thing you can type.

              13px mono, matching the body line it replaces — the sweep flags
              anything under 11px, and JetBrains Mono's large x-height means it
