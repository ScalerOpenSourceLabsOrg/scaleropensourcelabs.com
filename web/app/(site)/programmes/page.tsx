// into, what the club can actually do about it, and when the work has to start.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE ARGUMENT and it is not the obvious one. The obvious order is
// programmes → dates → tracks: here is the prize, here is the deadline, here is
// how to prepare. That puts the deadline before the reader has any idea what they
// would be preparing, which reads as pressure.
//
// So the programmes come first and split by tier — #open-entry ahead of #paid,
// for the reason spelled out over #open-entry — and preparation follows. What
// these are, then where a person like you actually starts, and the dates late
// enough that "applications are decided months before they open" is a useful
// fact rather than a reason to close the tab.
//
// A single undivided listing of all seven programmes used to sit under those two
// tiers, repeating this page's own <h1> as its heading. It is gone; see the note
// where it stood.

// `redirects` in next.config.js.

            under it every programme's what/who/when/pays/weDo in its own rows.
            Three problems, all of them structural rather than cosmetic.

            Its heading was the page's <h1> repeated WORD FOR WORD — "Paid,
            competitive, and open to beginners. Most students never apply because
            nobody told them these exist." A reader who scrolled past the masthead
            met the same sentence again and had to decide whether they had lost
            their place.

            Its rows carried the same five fields ProgrammeField already renders
            for #open-entry and #paid, from the same content/club.ts entries — so
            every paid programme appeared twice on one page, the second time with
            less detail: no "who from the club has done it", no "start preparing".
            The shorter copy of a thing always looks like the authoritative one
            because it is the one that fits on a screen.

            And it flattened the tier split. #open-entry and #paid exist to say
            "these two you can start today, these five you get selected into",
            which is the argument of the page; a single undivided list of all
            seven says the opposite immediately underneath.

            The gutter note it carried moved up into #paid, where its sentence was
            always pointed. */}

        {/* ---- Calendar -----------------------------------------------------
            The only honest urgency device the club owns. The argument is
            arithmetic, not a countdown: organisations select contributors who
            already have months of commits in their repo, so "next year" is a
            skipped cycle rather than a delay. No exact dates — they move annually
            and a stale date costs more than it buys on a page claiming accuracy. */}

            than a taste change. This section now sits directly under #paid, which
            is itself banded — two adjacent bands paint one continuous full-bleed
            tint, so the boundary between "here are the paid programmes" and "here
            is when they are decided" would disappear exactly where the page
            changes subject. Plain, it reads as its own section again. */}

              other timing claim on this page avoids naming a month for the same
              reason the table does, and a note that says "start in October" is
              wrong for eleven months of the year.

              KEPT SHORT, which is a constraint the gutter imposes rather than a
              style. A note is 160px wide and hangs 16px inside a container whose
              padding is the only thing between it and the text; every line it
              gains grows it downward past the eyebrow and alongside the heading,

              It spent a while at top-80 for one reason only: a flow note used to
              sit in the opposite margin at the top of this band, and two notes
              at one height read as a symmetrical ornament flanking the heading
              rather than as two separate remarks (see the vertical spacing note
              in Note.tsx). That note is gone, so the constraint is gone with it
              and this one is the only decoration in the section. */}

            A CARD GRID, not the stacked full-width rows this used to be.

            The rows were three near-identical bands of text: a heading in a 20rem
            left column, a paragraph in the right, repeated down the page. Nothing
            about that shape said "these are three parallel choices, pick one" —
            read top to bottom it looked like a sequence, which is the opposite of
            what the section means. Three cards side by side ARE the argument:
            equal weight, equal size, one decision.

            Three columns rather than the reference's four, because there are three
            tracks. A four-column grid with three cards leaves a hole in the row,
            and inventing a fourth to fill it would put a programme on the page
            that the club does not run. */}
