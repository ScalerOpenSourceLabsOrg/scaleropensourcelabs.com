                      in this design's type scale rather than the one it was written
                      for. `text-display-md` clamps to 1.9375rem here against 1.625rem
                      there — about 5px larger at the top of the ramp — and a repo name
                      like "scaleropensourcelabs.com" is one unbreakable token, so it
                      measured 375px inside a 390px viewport with padding either side
                      and took the document to 420px.

                      It was invisible in every obvious way: `body { overflow-x: hidden }`
                      clips the strip rather than showing a scrollbar, and the smoke
                      test's overflow check runs at desktop width. The QA sweep at 390px
                      is what caught it.

                      matters — `break-words` only breaks BETWEEN words, and there is no
                      space in a domain name to break at. `min-w-0` lets the flex item
