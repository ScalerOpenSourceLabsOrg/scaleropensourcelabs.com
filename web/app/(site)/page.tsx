// THE ESSENCE PAGE. What the club is, why it and not something else, and what it
// actually runs — then one way in.
//
// Fully static. No database, no auth, no API routes on this route — it is HTML and
// a handful of client components, so it renders identically anywhere and there is
// nothing to attack. The one place the site talks to a server is /join.
//
// Everything after the hero is deliberately quiet. The hero only reads as premium
// if what follows it is disciplined; a second spectacle cancels the first.
//
// WHAT THIS PAGE IS *NOT* CARRYING, and where each of those went, because the
// single-page version had all of it and a reader of this file will wonder:
//
//   the hall of selections   → /hall-of-fame
//   projects and upstream    → /projects
//   programmes, tracks, dates→ /programmes
//   team and mentors         → /team
//   what we look for, the
//     path, culture, FAQ     → /how-to-join
//   the application form     → /join
//   the institutional band   → the footer, on every route
//
// The four sections left here are the ones that answer "what is this and should I
// care", which is the only question a reader who has just arrived is asking.

        // neighbour's and the pair overlapped by 24px. The centre of "ICPC Regional
        // Rules" resolved to "ICPC 2025 standings": clicking the middle of the first
        // citation opened the second one. Measured with elementFromPoint, not
        // guessed, and invisible until the hover underline gave the row a visible

        // 14px of SYMMETRIC padding instead. No negative margin, so no overlap, and
        // 16px of line box plus 28px lands at 44px — which is the HIGHER of the two
        // numbers in play rather than a squeak past the lower one (WCAG 2.5.8 asks
        // 24px at AA; 2.5.5 and Apple's HIG want 44, and scripts/qa.mjs enforces 40).

        // measured 42.67px and passed; at 12px it measures 39.9996px, and the sweep
        // tests `height < 40`. Four ten-thousandths of a pixel, reported as "40x153" —

            Opening with the reader's own laptop rather than a definition. "Software
            built in public" is abstract; "the editor you have open on the other
            monitor is one of these, here is its source" is not, and it does the
            convincing before the definition arrives. */}

            The settle — the whole section moving 12px as one object — was the
            default because revealing every card and paragraph separately makes a
            page that twitches continuously as you scroll. That is still true of
            revealing every ELEMENT, and it is not what a group does: the container
            holds still and its direct children arrive in order, which on a section
            is eyebrow, then headline, then rule, then standfirst, then the grid.
            Four steps, once per section.
            It also switches on the two effects that only exist inside a group —
            the heading rule plotting itself and the highlighter wiping across a
            marked phrase — which were reaching four sections out of fourteen. */}

            claims making the same case in prose; the two read as the same
            argument made twice, so the prose went and the table stayed. It is
            the half that cites its cells AND stays legible at a glance. */}

              reader would keep. Void measured at 240px tall, 238px clear.

              anchor 59, THE ONE ON THIS PAGE THAT IS NOT SET BY ITS OWN INK, and
              the reason is a width nobody samples. This heading is the only one
              here that wraps to FILL its max-w-4xl cap: at 1180 the trail line
              "Open source does not." ends at 896px, i.e. flush with the column's
              own right edge, where at 1440 it ends at 724 and at 1024 at 786. An
              anchor derived from the wide measurement (52 was the first attempt)
              therefore reads clear at 1024, 1280, 1440 and 1800 and sits ON the
              headline at 1180 — which is exactly what scripts/tmp-notes-check.mjs
              caught, and nothing else would have.
              So it is anchored off the CAP (896 + 24 of padding + 24 of air)
              rather than off any measured line. The cost is that on a wide monitor
              it stands further out than its neighbours; the alternative is a note
              through a headline on a 1180px laptop. */}

            Three clubs on this campus want the same four years of your evenings.
            Here are six questions, asked of all three.
          </p>

          {/* A THREE-WAY TABLE, where this used to be a single column of claims
              stacked down a hairline.

              The old layout could only ever assert. Every row was a sentence about
              open source with a competitive-programming fact quoted inside it, so
              the comparison lived in the prose and the reader had to hold both
              halves in their head to see it. A grid does that work structurally:
              the row says which question is being asked, and the three cells are
              the three answers side by side. Nothing has to be claimed, because
              "unbounded" sitting in the same row as "three, per college, per year"
              is the argument.

              It is a real <table> rather than a grid of divs. The content IS
              tabular — six questions crossed with three clubs — and that means a
              screen reader can announce "OSC club, what it pays" when it lands in
              a cell, which is precisely the orientation a sighted reader gets for
              free from the column being under a heading.

              The horizontal scroll on narrow screens is the same trade the
              calendar table above makes: six rows of three paragraphs cannot be
              honestly reflowed into one phone column without either dropping the
              side-by-side reading or duplicating the whole table in a second
              markup path that then drifts from this one. */}

                win" came out four lines tall in a 5rem gutter. Fixed layout
                honours the one declared width and splits the remainder equally,
