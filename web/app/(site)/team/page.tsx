// THE TEAM PAGE. Who runs the club, and who teaches in it.
//
// A NEW ROUTE, and the one place this site's structure departs from the five-page
// version it was merged with. There, the org chart and the mentor list were folded
// into the hall of fame, on the reasoning that they are all pictures of people.
// They are answering different questions: the hall is "who did this club produce",
// which is evidence, and this is "who is behind it", which is trust. A student
// deciding whether to turn up on a Wednesday wants the second one, and burying it
// under twenty-five achievement cards makes it look like the answer is nobody.
//
// The mentor block is gated on `publishedMentors()` rather than rendering an empty
// state, and that gate is deliberately around the WHOLE section: a "Mentors"
// heading over nothing says the club has no mentors, which is worse than the
// heading not being there.

          Everyone on this page graduates. A club that depends on the people

            Directly after Mentors, and that adjacency is the point: both sections
            answer "who are the humans here", so they belong in one spread rather
            than scattered either side of an argument. Mentors goes first because a
            prospective member cares more about who reviews their patch than who
            books the room.

            Deliberately NOT near the top. Eight named office-holders ahead of the
            hall would be the club introducing itself before it has shown that
            anybody outside it agreed — the same reason the hall leads the page.
            Placed here it also sets up #institutional below, which asks a faculty
            member to email organisers this section has just named.

            aria-label, despite the section having a visible eyebrow: Outline names
            a section from its aria-label first, then a `.label` eyebrow, then its
            heading — and this eyebrow is a `.chip`. Without this the outline entry
            would be the Duo headline cut at 33 characters ("11 people run this club.
            2 are sh…"). It is also the landmark's accessible name, and matches the
            nav link that points here. */}

              been here twice and a future pass will be tempted to restore it a
              third time.

              It read "Who to ask. / That is the only question this section
              exists to answer." — a near-verbatim echo of the standfirst three
              lines below it ("This page exists to answer one question: who to
              ask"). An earlier comment here logged that overlap as the known
              cost of the version and asked that the two be kept in step, which
              is the wrong trade: Note.tsx's whole bar is that a note must say
              something its section does not, and a note whose job is to repeat
              the paragraph beside it is spending the margin on nothing. The
              standfirst keeps who-to-ask; it says it once and says it better.

              So the margin now answers the question the chart CANNOT: not who
              holds which office, but why eleven students bother. It is the one
              warm sentence beside a deliberately formal org chart, which is the
              contrast the note format is for — and it is second-person, where
              everything else in this section is third.

              The count is interpolated rather than written, for the same reason
              the headline's is: teamSize() includes the content desk, so a
              hand-typed number here goes stale the first time somebody joins
              it.

              anchor 49: the headline's second clause ends at 737px, so 784 sits
              47px off it. Unchanged, and it stays valid only because the Duo
              above was left exactly as it was — this number is derived from that
              headline's line break, so re-word the heading and this needs
              re-measuring, not adjusting by eye. */}

        {/* THE WHOLE SECTION IS GATED, not just its list. Mentors.tsx used to
            carry an empty state — a dashed box reading "No mentors listed yet" —
            and with MENTORS empty that was the entire visible content of this
            section: a chip, a headline, a paragraph promising that "each entry
            says what they shipped", and then a box admitting there are no
            entries. Deleting only the box would have left the promise standing
            over nothing, which reads worse than the box did.

            So the gate lives here rather than in the component, because the copy
            it has to suppress lives here too. Add a mentor to content/club.ts and
            the section returns in full, unchanged — nothing about it was deleted.
