// THE APPLICATION FORM. One route, one job.
//
// It carries no NextAction, and it is the only route that does not: the form IS
// the next action, and a closing "here is what to do next" band underneath a
// half-filled form is an invitation to abandon it.
//
// It does now close on a band, but the distinction above is what that band is
// built to respect — it contains no link, so it argues for the form rather than
// offering somewhere else to be. Anything added down there has to clear the same
// bar: no exits under an unfinished form.
//
// It is also absent from PAGES, so it appears in neither the nav strip nor beside
// the other routes in the footer. The nav carries it as a filled button at the
// other end of the bar — putting the same word in the strip as well would be the
// site's one action said twice in one component.
//
// The form used to sit immediately below the hero on a single-page site, because
// with one page that was the only way to keep it within one scroll of the top.
// With its own route it is one click from every screen instead, which is strictly
// better, and the section around it can be about the form rather than being a
// compromise between the form and the hero above it.

            The form cannot live INSIDE the hero: that hero is sticky and
            scroll-scrubbed, and animating a background under someone who is
            filling in fields is hostile. Scaler's hero carries its form because
            their hero is static. So the form gets the very next band instead —
            one scroll, still the second thing you meet, and it keeps both
            mechanics intact. */}
        {/* `relative` so the sticker below anchors to this section rather than to
            the page. Each sticker is positioned against the section it belongs to,
            so none of them can drift when a section above changes height. */}
        <section id="apply" className="section page-top relative pb-8">
          {/* THE THREE STICKERS, and the rule they all now follow.
              A negative inset only means "hang into the margin" when a margin
              exists. `.section` caps at 88rem, so below ~1600px viewport there is
              no gutter at all and a negative offset hangs off the SCREEN instead:
              the bottom-right sticker was pushing the document 16-40px wider than
              the viewport across the entire 1024-1360px band, which covers most
              laptops.
              It went unseen because `body { overflow-x: hidden }` clips the strip
              rather than producing a scrollbar, and because the QA sweep tests
              390, 834 and 1440 — the band sits exactly between the last two.
              So: flush insets by default, negative ones only past 1600px.

              AND A FLUSH INSET IS INSIDE THE TEXT COLUMN, which is the half of
              that rule the vertical position has to answer for. `left-0` on a
              container whose gutter has not appeared yet does not mean "in the
              margin" — it means "on top of the first thing in the left column",
              and the only reason it ever looked otherwise was that `top-14`
              landed inside this section's 96px of top padding. A later spacing
              pass cut that padding to 48/64px and the sticker came to rest
              exactly on the eyebrow above the headline, at EVERY width from
              1024 up.
              So a flush sticker needs a band that is empty in both axes, not
              just a corner. */}
          {/* THE "WORKS ON MY MACHINE" STICKER USED TO SIT HERE, AND IT WAS LANDING
              ON THE "FREE" TILE AT EVERY WIDTH IT RENDERED AT. Measured, not guessed:
              at 1280 the sticker occupied y 567-607 / x -1-249 and the tile occupied
              y 563-665 / x 24-274; at 1440 it was 532-572 over a tile at 524-630; at
              1600, 581-620 over 571-678. A direct hit on the word "Free" in all three.

              Its own comment said it sat in "350-450px of dead space at the bottom of
              the left column", and that was true when the left column carried more copy
              and the form beside it was a tall anonymous one. Sign-in replaced that form
              with a short card, the left column now ends at these two tiles, and the
              dead space the sticker was placed in stopped existing — so `bottom-24`
              stopped meaning "under the copy" and started meaning "on top of it".

              It is removed rather than moved because there is no longer an empty band on
              this section to move it to: both columns end within 10px of each other, and
              inventing space for a decoration on the page whose whole brief is "less
              crowded" is the wrong trade. The gutter note below stays, so the section
              keeps a sticker voice without a sticker sitting on the content. */}
          {/* Opposite gutter, level with the form itself — it answers the first
              thing anybody wonders while looking at a sign-up form.

              THE POINT IS THE ABSENT SECOND TIER, not the price. "Free" alone is
              a word every programme on the internet uses about its entry level,
              and a reader who has met a few of those hears it as "free until the
              part that matters". What is actually unusual here is that there is
              no part that matters more — nobody is kept out of a room because of
              where they sit in the club — so the note says that instead, and the
              price follows from it. The "Free" tile a few inches away already
              carries the fee.

              IT IS SPECIFICALLY *SESSIONS* THAT ARE UNDIVIDED, AND SPECIFICALLY
              REPOS THAT ARE NOT. An earlier draft read "same mentors, same
              repos, everyone", which is not true and is not even the thing being
              claimed: #tracks below sorts the work into three named difficulties
              on purpose, because handing a first-timer an advanced codebase
              helps nobody. That division is a match to what you can currently
              read, and it moves as you do. The division this note rules out is
              the other kind — a rank inside the club that decides which room you
              are allowed into. Keep those two apart in any rewrite; collapsing
              them either makes the club sound undifferentiated or makes the
              tracks sound like tiers. */}

                The argument for the anonymous form was real and is worth stating: making
                somebody hold a Google account before they may apply puts a requirement in
                front of the club's front door, and the headline three inches to the left
                promises the opposite. That is true of a club that admits anybody.

                This one does not. Membership IS an @sst.scaler.com address — that is the
                whole test, and it is the one thing an application form cannot check. A
                form asks a stranger to type an address they may not own and leaves an
                organiser to verify it by hand; signing in with the college account proves
                it in one tap and produces a record nobody had to check. So the door and
                the test are the same act now, and there is no application to read.

            The closing band, and the exception the comment at the top of this
            file now carries: it is not a NextAction. Every other route ends by
            handing you somewhere else to go, which under a half-filled form
            would be an exit. This band has no link in it at all. It restates
            the decision already on the screen and then stops, so the only
            thing to do with it is scroll back up and finish.

            NOT INSIDE THE SIGN-IN CARD. It lived in the card for one revision and the
            card is the wrong container: at 15px inside a 7-unit padded tile it
            read as a third disclaimer under the two grey notes about data, and
            disclaimers are what people skip. On the page at display-md it is
            the loudest type below the hero.

            The asymmetry is the whole argument. Both eyebrows take .label, so
            they read as one pair rather than a warning and a reward — the
            weight sits in the body copy instead: `dust` on the left, `ink` on
            the right, plus the accent rule down the right column. The future
            where you did nothing is literally the dimmer of the two.
            Do not try to colour the eyebrow to sharpen it: .label sets its own
            colour and every custom class in globals.css is declared after
            @tailwind utilities, so a text-* utility on it silently does
            nothing. See the note on .page-top there. */}
