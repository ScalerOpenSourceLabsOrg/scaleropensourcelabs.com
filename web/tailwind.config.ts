// TYPE — one family, three weights, doing all the work.
// Apple's coherence doesn't come from pairing display and body faces; it comes
// from using a single grotesque everywhere and letting size, weight and spacing
// carry the hierarchy. So: Instrument Sans across the whole site, with JetBrains
// Mono reserved strictly for identifiers (repo names, counts, labels) where
// tabular figures and a technical register are doing real work.
//
// COLOUR — derived from the subject, not from taste.
// The hero is a rocket ascent, so the palette is deep space plus ignition. The
// accent is CYAN, because a rocket at full burn exhausts blue-white — orange
// flame is a low-temperature, cartoon reading of the same object. It also
// sidesteps the near-black-plus-acid-green and near-black-plus-vermilion pairs
// that every AI-generated dark site currently arrives at. Ember is the warm
// counterpoint and appears almost nowhere: one number, one state, then stop.

        // used -0.04em — nearly three times tighter — which is why it read as
        // cramped and shouty instead of composed. Apple is a far lighter touch
        // than it looks; the authority comes from size and space, not squeeze.
        //
        // LINE HEIGHT, loosened a step across the whole scale.
        //
        // The old values were Apple's, measured: 84/80 = 1.05 at display size. They
        // are correct for Apple's face and wrong for ours. SF Pro has a compact
        // vertical footprint; Syne — the display face here — has tall ascenders, deep
        // descenders and, at 800, very heavy stems. At 1.08 a two-line heading like
        // "Somebody else picked them. GSoC, LFX Mentorship…" put the descender of
        // "picked" almost into the cap-height of the line beneath it, and the pair of
        // lines fused into one dark block that has to be decoded rather than read.
        //
        // The rule this follows: leading scales DOWN as size goes up, but the floor is
        // set by the face's own extenders, not by a ratio copied from another type
        // system. Every step below is one notch looser than the value it replaces, and
        // the ordering (1.12 < 1.22 < 1.32 < 1.62 < 1.72) is preserved — display type
        // still sets tighter than body, which is the part of Apple's system that does
        // transfer.
        // SIZE, raised a step on every sans-carrying entry — for a reason specific to
        // this typeface rather than a general "make it bigger".
        //
        // Plus Jakarta Sans is a geometric humanist with long ascenders and
        // descenders, and it spends that vertical room on the EXTENDERS rather than
        // on the x-height. So its lowercase sits visibly shorter in the line than a
        // large-x-height grotesque — Inter, Helvetica, SF — set at the identical px
        // value. Nothing here was "too small" by the numbers; the numbers were
        // inherited from a system built on a face that puts more of the em into the
        // part of the letter you actually read.
        //
        // The correction is therefore on font-size, not on some x-height trick:
        // `font-size-adjust` would reach the same rendered x-height by scaling the
        // face, but it does it invisibly — the computed size stays 16px while the
        // glyphs render as ~17px, so every later measurement, clamp and rem
        // calculation on this page would be reasoning about a number that is not what
        // is on screen. Stating the real size keeps the scale honest.
        //
        // Caps-only steps were deliberately NOT bumped by that pass: `label` below,
        // and .chip/.btn/.step/.num/.status-pill in globals.css. Capitals have no
        // x-height to be short of — they already fill from baseline to cap-height —
        // so the same increase there would just make the badges bigger for no
        // legibility gain. Nor was `xs`: 27 of its 28 uses in this codebase are
        // `font-mono`, and JetBrains Mono has a large x-height and does not have this
        // problem.
        //
        // THERE WAS A +2px PASS AFTER THAT ONE, AND IT HAS BEEN REVERSED. It raised
        // every step below — the caps ones too, overriding the exemption above on the
        // grounds that "raise the whole page by 2px" is a uniform instruction and a
        // scale where six steps grew and four held is no longer the scale either pass
        // designed. That reasoning was sound and the result was still too big: on a
        // 1280px viewport it put 19px under every card row and 16px under every
        // eyebrow, and the page read as though it were being viewed at 110% zoom.
        //
        // So every step is back down by exactly 2px, which is the inverse of the
        // instruction that raised it — not a fresh set of numbers. What that lands on
        // is the scale the x-height pass produced and nothing earlier: 17px body,
        // which is Apple's body size and the reference the tracking values here were
        // measured from, 15px sm, 12px xs, 11px label. The per-face correction that
        // put them there is untouched, because it was answering a different question
        // and it was right.
        //
        // On the fluid steps the reversal is `calc(<vw> + 0.125rem)` back to a raw
        // `<vw>`, as well as -2px on both ends, and the calc is the part worth not
        // getting wrong in either direction. Move only the min and max and the clamp
        // still resolves to the RAW vw value at every viewport between them — so the
        // type would change at the two extremes and hold across the middle of the
        // range, which is most desktop widths. The offset has to ride the interpolated
        // term to be a real 2px everywhere rather than at the endpoints only.
        // THE vw TERMS ARE BACK AT THEIR FULL VALUE. They were multiplied by 0.75 to
        // ride the `html { font-size: 75% }` that used to sit in globals.css, so that
        // headings shrank across the middle of the viewport range along with the rem
        // ends. That root is gone — it was making the whole site render at three
        // quarters of the sizes measured below — so a 0.75 vw term would now hold the
        // OLD size across most desktop widths while the ends grew, which is the exact
        // failure the note above describes, in reverse.
        // ONE ELEMENT ON THE SITE WEARS THIS: the home page hero, which is two words.

        // and merely large. At 84px a sixteen-word title — "Paid, competitive, and open
        // to beginners. Most students never apply because nobody told them these
        // exist." — is four lines that fill a 1440x900 viewport on their own, with the

        // steps inside 2.3px, which is not a hierarchy anybody can see. Worse, the gap
