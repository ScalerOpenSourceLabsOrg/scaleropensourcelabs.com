// The hero's right-hand column: the reader's first contribution, typed out.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY. This box used to be a live-looking feed of named
// students — "Prateek Singh 46 merged in OWASP/OpenCRE", "Ojas Maheshwari
// selected into GSoC", "+12 more this cohort". Every line was true and every
// line was read from content/club.ts, so it was not a factual problem. It was a
// FAIRNESS problem, and that is the harder one:
//
//   * Four names fit. Fifteen people are in the cohort. The four in the hero
//     were whoever the array happened to sort first — an editorial ranking the
//     club never made, printed in its largest, most-seen component.
//   * It is the first thing a prospective member reads, and it says "here are
//     the people who already made it." That is the exact belief the page spends
//     the rest of its length dismantling.
//
// So the box now addresses the reader instead of the alumni. It is the same
// object — dark terminal, mono, ambient indigo glow — running a session that
// belongs to whoever is looking at it. The session is the real workflow, in the
// real order, and it ends where the headline four inches to its left starts:
// your name in the commit log.
//
// The evidence did not go anywhere. It moved to where it was already stronger:
// the floating chips still carry the API-verified merge count and the cohort
// size (see Hero.tsx), the figure block under the hero states the total, and the
// hall names every one of them with links. Nobody lost a credit; the credit stopped
// being a leaderboard.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A CLAIM. That is the other thing the change buys. A simulated
// shell typing `git commit` is self-evidently a demonstration, not an assertion
// about a person's record — so it cannot be checked and found false, which is
// what the old version's every line risked. The one placeholder that could read
// as a claim, the repo being cloned, is written as `<a-project-that-needs-help>`
// rather than a real slug, because naming one project in the hero would re-run
// the same favouritism at the repo level.
//
// The dark fill is FIXED rather than themed, unchanged from the previous
// version. A terminal is a terminal; inverting it in light mode would make it a
// white box with syntax colours, which is not the object being depicted. It also
// means the contrast pairs inside are measured once instead of once per theme —
// every colour below sits on #0F172A at 6.4:1 or better.

/* THE SESSION.
 *
 * Coloured per fragment rather than by a syntax highlighter, because the typing
 * animation slices this array mid-word and a real tokeniser would be re-lexing a
 * half-written command sixty times a second to produce the same six colours.
 *
 * On the command choice: `git init` / `git add .` / `git commit` / `git push`
 * was the first draft and it is the wrong sequence for this page. `git init`
 * starts a NEW repository — it is what you run on your own empty folder. Nobody
 * joins open source that way; you clone something that already exists and add to
 * it, which is the entire point the club is making. The order below is what a
 * first contribution actually looks like, so a sixteen-year-old who copies it
 * verbatim ends up somewhere real. The commit message survived from that draft
 * intact, because it is the best line in the box.
 *
 * The opening `git log --author="you"` is what ties this to the headline. It
 * asks the page's question — is your name in here? — gets the honest answer for
 * a reader who has not started yet, and then spends five lines fixing it.
