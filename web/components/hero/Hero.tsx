// The hero, as a thesis rather than a spectacle.
//
// It was a scroll-scrubbed WebGL rocket on a launchpad across 220vh, with a
// CSS fallback, capability detection and a stage machine. That is gone at the
// client's instruction, and what replaces it is the register both reference sites
// actually use: apple.com and Scaler's School of Business are type-led, with the
// claim doing the work and hard numbers immediately under it.
//
// Reading the SSB page closely, the pattern is consistent — a positioning
// sentence, two calls to action, and no imagery to speak of. So this states the
// claim and then gets out of the way: the selection count that used to sit under
// the buttons is now made once, at the head of the hall, where the names that
// back it are on the same screen. Saying it twice on one scroll made the reader
// re-read rather than recognise it.
//
// This is a server component: no canvas, no capability detection, no scroll
// listener, no state. The previous hero needed all four and could only be checked
// by rendering it. This one cannot fail in a way HTML cannot express.
//
// One height rule: it deliberately does NOT force h-screen. A viewport-locked hero
// pushes the section under it off the fold on a laptop, which is exactly where the
// argument continues.

/* The floating chips anchored to the terminal's corners.
 *
 * Positions and colours are the brief's exactly: purple top-right, mint
 * bottom-left, each led by its coloured circle emoji.
 *
 * The FIGURES are not. The brief asks for "🟣 140+ PRs Merged" and
 * "🟢 $12,000+ Earned"; the repo's verified merge count is 46, and there is no
 * earnings figure anywhere in the content — not in PROJECTS, not in SELECTIONS,
 * not in the copy. Inventing one on a recruitment page aimed at sixteen-year-olds
 * is the single most consequential number that could be wrong here, because
 * "students earn money doing this" is the claim most likely to change what
 * somebody does next.
 *
 * So the chips carry what the club can actually show: the API-verified merge
 * count, and the size of the published cohort. Both grow on their own as entries
 * are added. A chip with nothing true to say does not render, which is why each
 * is guarded separately rather than the pair being one block.
 *
 * lg only. They are absolutely positioned over a column that does not exist below
 * lg, and a decorative element that can push a phone into a horizontal scroll is
 * a defect rather than a flourish.

          tall, so -20px puts roughly 5px of it inside the card and the rest
          outside. That is what reads as a sticker stuck to the corner.

          The first attempt put this second badge at `top-24 -left-10`, which
          floated it across the middle of the card — directly over the
          contributor rank and the merged count. A decorative badge covering the
          real evidence is the worst possible arrangement of these two elements,
          and it is only obvious once rendered.

          `.chip` declares `display: inline-block`, and globals.css is emitted
          after Tailwind's utilities layer, so at equal specificity the class
          beats `hidden`. Both badges therefore rendered at every width,

          390px phone the violet one sat at negative x, half off the left edge of
          the screen.

          Nothing reported it. `body` sets `overflow-x: hidden`, so the escaping
          element was clipped rather than made scrollable, and the QA sweep's
          overflow check looks for a document wider than the viewport — which it
          never was. It took looking at a phone screenshot. The wrapper is a

      {/* The ambient lighting. Two orbs rather than one, placed off the diagonal
          of the split below: a large one at the top-left behind the headline, a
          smaller one low on the right behind the terminal. One centred orb reads
          as a vignette; two off-axis read as light falling across the section.

          THE INSETS FOLLOW THE SAME RULE AS THE STICKERS — see the note over
          Sticker 1 in app/page.tsx. A negative inset only means "hang into the
          margin" where a margin exists, and `.section` caps at 88rem, so below
          about 1600px there is no gutter and a negative offset hangs off the
          screen instead. On the RIGHT that widens the document, which is exactly
          the defect that pass fixed; `body { overflow-x: hidden }` clips the
          strip so it never shows up as a scrollbar and nothing reports it.

          Only the right-hand orb needs gating on the INSET. In LTR the scrollable
          overflow region does not extend leftwards — content at negative x is
          clipped and unreachable, never scrolled to — so `-left-32` costs
          nothing at any width and the headline keeps its off-page light source
          everywhere.

          Losing the right-hand bleed below 1600px costs almost nothing anyway: a
          radial gradient that is fully transparent by 70% of its radius has no
          boundary to hide, so flush against the container it still pools inward
          as light rather than reading as a shape.

          THE SIZES ARE RESPONSIVE, and that is a bug fix rather than a
          refinement. A negative LEFT inset is safe, but the orb's own WIDTH is
          not: at 34rem the box is 544px, so pulled 128px left it still reached
          x=416 on a 390px viewport and dragged the document to 417. The QA sweep
          caught it as one page overflow plus four elements, and the nav was among
          them — a `position: fixed` header sizes to the layout viewport, which on
          mobile widens to the overflow, so an invisible decoration in the hero was
          stretching the plate at the top of the screen. Nothing visible would
          have shown it; `body { overflow-x: hidden }` clips the strip.

          Smaller on a phone is the better design anyway. A 544px blur on a 390px
          screen is not lighting, it is a flat tint over the whole section.

          These sit behind the header's own content at z-index -1 and cannot be
          hit — see `.glow-orb`. */}

          and a 96px `-right-24` needs 1408 + 2*104 = 1616 before it fits. The
          left-hand Glow above needs no gate at any width — negative LEFT offsets are
