"use client";

// The scrolling strip of programmes and ecosystems.
//
// The loop is two identical copies of one list translated by exactly half the
// track — see `.ticker` in globals.css for why that is the whole mechanic and
// why the separator has to live inside each item rather than being a gap.
//
// IT IS A CLIENT COMPONENT FOR ONE REASON: the pause button. Everything else
// here is static markup and would have been happier on the server, and the first
// version of this file was — pausing on `:hover` in CSS and calling that the
// stop mechanism.
//
// That is not sufficient. WCAG 2.2.2 (Pause, Stop, Hide, Level A) applies to
// content that moves automatically, runs for more than five seconds and sits
// beside other content; this moves forever. A hover rule serves a pointer and
// nobody else — there is nothing focusable inside the strip, so a keyboard user
// has no way to reach it, and `prefers-reduced-motion` only helps the people who
// have already found and set it. The criterion asks for a control, so there is a
// control. The hover rule stays as a convenience on top of it.
//
// NAMES, NOT LOGOS, and it is the same call this page already makes in the
// programmes section: those marks belong to Google, the Linux Foundation, the
// CNCF and others, and setting them in a row on a club's recruitment page states
// a relationship nobody granted. Typeset names say "this is the ecosystem the
// work lands in", which is true and checkable; a wall of trademarks says
// "partners", which is not.
//
// THE NON-ENDORSEMENT LINE THAT USED TO SIT UNDER THIS STRIP IS GONE, removed on
// request. The disclaimer itself is not lost — the footer carries it on every
// route ("Programme and organisation names are trademarks of their respective
// owners… not an endorsement by any programme or company"), which is a better
// home for it anyway: it is chrome, it is site-wide, and it no longer explains a
// decorative strip to a reader who had not yet wondered. If the footer note ever
// goes, this strip is one of the places that relied on it.
//
// THE STRIP IS HALF DERIVED AND HALF LOCAL, and the split is the point.
//
// The PROGRAMMES half is read out of club.ts, so this strip lists exactly the
// programmes /programmes documents — no more, no fewer. It used to name two of
// them by hand while that page described seven, which is the kind of drift that
// is invisible until somebody notices the ticker is advertising a shorter list
// than the page it sits two clicks from. Add a programme to PROGRAMMES and it
// appears here; remove one and it leaves.
//
// The PROJECTS half stays a local array, and deliberately does NOT move into
// club.ts. Everything in that file is data some other section derives a claim
// from, and a reader meeting this list there would reasonably assume the club
// has a relationship with each entry. It does not: this is the ecosystem the
// work lands in, which is a weaker and truer statement.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS A CLAIM ABOUT WORK DONE, and that now holds without exception.
// OWASP was briefly on this list because it is the one upstream project with a
// verified contribution behind it — which is exactly why it does not belong on a
// decorative strip. A real, checkable contribution is worth more stated as a
// contribution, where it links to the evidence, than dissolved into a scrolling
// band of names a reader cannot tell apart. It is already on /projects, ranked
// and sourced. Keep this list aspirational-but-honest: ecosystems, not receipts.

          the outline panel used to reserve a right-hand gutter and cost `.band`
          and `.stories` exactly that. A strip that stops at the container needs
          none of it, and reads as an object on the page, which suits the black

          control fades out exactly as it approaches the edge it is pinned to.
          So the frame holds the border, the shadow and the button, and the
          masked, clipped viewport is a child of it.
