// The signed-in area's own header. NOT the site nav.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT THE SITE NAV. /dashboard used to carry the marketing bar — Essence,
// Projects, Programmes, Hall of Fame, Team, How to Join, and a filled JOIN button that
// had relabelled itself to DASHBOARD and pointed at the page you were already on. Every
// one of those is an argument aimed at somebody deciding whether to join. A member who
// has joined is past that argument, and a control that navigates you to where you already
// are is the clearest possible signal that a page is wearing somebody else's chrome.
//
// So the signed-in routes get their own shell: the wordmark back to the public site, the
// account you are signed in as, and the theme control. Nothing that sells the club to
// somebody who is already in it.
//
// THE GEOMETRY IS DELIBERATELY IDENTICAL to the site nav — 0.75rem inset, a 3.5rem plate,
// same `.plate` fill and blur. `.page-top` and `scroll-padding-top` in globals.css are
// both derived from that height and there is exactly one copy of the number; a header of
// a different height here would need a second copy, which is the thing that comment
// forbids. Same object, different contents.
