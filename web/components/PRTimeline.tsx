// What actually happens to a pull request, as a timeline.
//
// This is the site's most useful diagram, and it earns its place by removing a
// specific fear rather than by decorating a section. The reason first-years do not
// open pull requests is not that they cannot write the code — it is that they have
// no model of what happens after they press the button, so the whole thing feels
// like submitting an exam to a stranger. Showing the loop, including the step where
// somebody asks for changes, is what makes it look survivable.
//
// So "Changes requested" is drawn as a normal step in the sequence and not as a
// failure state. It carries the ember token — the site's single signal colour — for
// exactly one reason: it is the step readers are afraid of, so it is the step worth
// pointing at. The copy next to it says it is the normal case, because it is.
//
// BUILT IN THE DOM, NOT AS AN SVG, and that was a deliberate reversal. The first
// version was one inline <svg> with <text> nodes, which looked right at 1440px and
// failed everywhere else: the labels do not reflow, they ignore the reader's font
// size, they cannot be selected or translated, and a screen reader gets one long
// unpunctuated string. Line art belongs in SVG; anything with words in it belongs
// in the DOM. The rail here is a CSS border and the dots are divs, so the whole
// thing is a normal <ol> that happens to have a line drawn down the side of it.
//
// It is a diagram of the mechanism, not a claim about our data. Nothing here is a
// number, so there is nothing to source.
