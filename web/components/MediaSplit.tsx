// The media split: a large framed visual beside a 2x2 of what the club actually
// runs.
//
// THE LEFT FRAME, AND THE ONE HONEST PROBLEM IN THIS SECTION.
//
// The brief asks for "a photo of students collaborating at laptops". This repo
// contains no images at all — `public/` holds a single README explaining how to
// add them, and not one entry in content/club.ts has a `photo` set. So there are
// three ways to fill this frame and only one of them is defensible:
//
//   * A stock photograph of unrelated people, captioned as this club. That is a
//     misrepresentation on a page whose entire argument is that its claims are
//     checkable, and it is the version most sites ship.
//   * An empty grey box with "image goes here". Honest and unshippable.
//   * What this does: render the real photograph THE MOMENT one exists at the
//     path below, and until then compose the frame out of the club's real member
//     tiles — the same pastel monogram treatment the hall already uses for
//     everyone who has not supplied a picture.
//
// The fallback is a designed state, not an error state: four member tiles, the
// contribution wall's colour language, and a caption that says what it is. It
// does not pretend to be a photograph, so nothing here can be read as one.
//
// To ship the real thing: drop the image at public/people/ per the README there
// and set PHOTO below. Nothing else changes.

      {/* THE TITLE BLOCK. Every other section on the page opens with a chip and a
          Duo; this one used to open with the frame itself, so the 2x2 arrived with
          nothing telling a reader what it was a list OF.

          Same three parts as the reference site's: a label, a two-clause headline
          split across a colour change, and one line of subtitle with a single
          phrase lifted out of it. The parts are this site's own — `.chip`, Duo's
          ink/blue split, `.mark` — rather than a copy of theirs, which is what
          keeps this section looking like the eleven above it.

          LEFT-ALIGNED, and that is the one deliberate departure from the
          screenshot. The reference centres its heading over a centred grid; every
          section here hangs off the left margin, and Duo's hand-drawn underline is
          fixed-width from that margin — centring this one block would have left it
          the only heading on the page that does not line up with the rest.

          Sentence case, per the rule in Duo's header: caps are for labels, and a
          two-clause sentence in the display face at this size is a wall. The chip
          above it is a label, so the chip is the part that shouts. */}
      {/* Moved here from #culture, where it annotated a headline about arguing
          over code from a section that never said what a session IS. This is the
          section that does — "Regular commit sessions: open laptops, one issue
          each" is the first card in the 2x2 below — so the note now reads as a
          remark about the thing beside it rather than as a second way of saying
          the headline.

          It is also the only note between #culture and #tracks, so nothing here
          shares a horizontal level with it; the two decorations either side are
          hundreds of pixels clear. See the vertical spacing note in Note.tsx.

          anchor 51, measured rather than guessed, per Note.tsx —
          scripts/tmp-measure.mjs prints exactly this. The furthest-right ink in
          the note's y band is the Duo's trail at 737px from the container's left
          edge (1440 and 1800; 709 at 1280, 658 at 1180, 578 at 1024), so 816
          leaves 79px of air at the widest wrap and more at every narrower one.
          The clamp in `.note-flow` takes over below ~1180.

          THE VERTICAL IS THE TIGHT ONE HERE, not the horizontal. The band runs
          from the top of the section to the `.measure` standfirst, which is
          full-width and would sit straight under the note: 242px at 1024, where
          the note is at its TALLEST because w-40 wraps the body to five lines.
          That leaves 25px, and it is why the body lost "Sessions are" — at six
          lines the foot came within 5px of the paragraph. From xl the note is
          160px and there are 110+. A longer body has to lose a line rather than
          move down. */}
