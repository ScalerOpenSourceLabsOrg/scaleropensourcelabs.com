// The one closing action a route is allowed.
//
// THIS IS THE #join BAND FROM THE SINGLE-PAGE SITE, turned into a component. When
// the whole site was one scroll, a closing "Want your name in the commit log?"
// appeared exactly once, at the bottom, and that was the correct number. Split
// across seven routes the same band has to appear seven times, and the moment a
// thing repeats it needs a rule — otherwise each page grows its own closer, each
// closer grows a second "or read more about X" link, and the site becomes a maze
// one individually-defensible link at a time.
//
// So the shape is fixed here and the pages only supply words. There is ONE href.
// Where a page genuinely serves two intentions, the difference belongs in which
// destination the button preselects, not in a second control beside it.
//
// The styling is unchanged from the band it came from, and so is the argument for
// each part of it:
//
//   * CENTRED, unlike every other section on the site, because this one is
//     structurally a tile rather than an argument: short headline, one supporting
//     line, one action. The content sections stay left-aligned deliberately —
//     their headlines are two-clause arguments over three lines, and centred
//     ragged text at that length is measurably harder to read.
//
//   * The `.seam-fade` hairline above it. It is what makes the band read as the
//     end of the page rather than as one more section, which matters more now
//     than it did: on a single page the footer was visibly next, and on a route
//     the reader has to be told the argument has finished.
//
//   * The group is the inner block, NOT the section. The section's other child is
//     that 1px rule, and a hairline sliding 20px up on reveal is the one thing
//     here that would read as a rendering fault rather than as motion.
