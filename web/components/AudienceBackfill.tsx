// A ONE-TIME MIGRATION, WITH A BUTTON, AND IT DISAPPEARS WHEN IT IS DONE.
//
// WHY THIS IS UI AND NOT A SCRIPT. Every other repo would put this in scripts/ and run
// it once from a laptop. This one cannot: the site is a static export with no server,
// the only Firebase credentials in existence belong to a signed-in organiser, and
// sign-in is Google-only — so there is no headless way to authenticate as somebody
// allowed to make these writes. `firebase-admin` and a service-account key would create
// a second, stronger credential for the club to look after, for one afternoon's work.
// The organisers' page is where admin-authorised code already runs.
//
// WHAT IT FIXES, AND WHY DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION. Announcements, sessions and
// forms written before the audience picker existed carry no `audience` field. The rules
// read that as "everyone", so those documents are still permitted to every reader — but
// permission is not the problem. Every member-facing read now carries
// `where("audience", "in", …)`, and a Firestore inequality does not match documents that
// lack the field AT ALL. A notice with no audience is therefore invisible to everybody
// except an organiser, whose query has no such clause. It looks deleted. Stamping the
// default explicitly is what puts it back.
//
// IT RENDERS NOTHING WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DO, so it is not a permanent button
// waiting to be pressed by mistake — after one successful run this component is a blank
// space on the page, and whoever eventually deletes it can see it was finished.
