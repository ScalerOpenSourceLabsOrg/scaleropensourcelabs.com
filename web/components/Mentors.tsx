// Mentors.
//
// A student mentor is not a professor, and a page implying otherwise is detectable
// in one line. The programmes that handle peer mentorship credibly — Outreachy,
// GSoC, Recurse Center — all redefine authority away from rank: Outreachy states
// mentor eligibility purely as hours committed, GSoC defines a mentor by duty
// rather than qualification, and Recurse establishes seniority by naming an
// artifact, attaching a number, and stopping.
//
// So an entry here is: a named artifact, a public link proving it, an explicit
// boundary on what they are useful for, and a bounded availability. No adjectives
// describing the person. Count the adjectives applied to a human on Recurse's
// residents page and you get zero — every one is attached to a thing.
//
// The word "lifelong" never appears, despite being the brief. Asserting duration
// spends it and proves nothing; Techstars writes "more than a program — it's a
// lifelong network" and an engineer discounts the page on sight. Instead each entry
// records who mentored THEM. After two or three cohorts that renders as a visible
// lineage — the same name appearing as mentee in one row and mentor in another —
// which demonstrates durability and cannot be faked.
