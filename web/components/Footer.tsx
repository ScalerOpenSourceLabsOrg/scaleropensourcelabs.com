// The footer, on every page.
//
// It carries the two audiences that have no page of their own — faculty and
// sponsors, and maintainers — for the reason given over INSTITUTIONAL in club.ts:
// every route is addressed to a student deciding whether to join, and a
// "for sponsors" band inserted into one of them would compete with that page's
// single next action. Chrome is the right place for an audience that is not the
// page's audience.
//
// It deliberately does NOT repeat the Join button. The nav carries that action at
// every scroll position on every route, so a copy down here would be the third
// thing on screen saying the same word — and the one a reader has already learned
// to skip. Each page's own closing action sits above this.
//
// The page list is derived from PAGES, so a route cannot appear in the nav and be
// missing here.
//
// IT IS AN INVERTED SURFACE — dark on a light page, light on a dark one. Done by
// dropping `.inverse` on the element, which redefines the tokens for the subtree
// rather than setting colours on the children, so everything inside flips
// including the accent and the Console below inherits the flip for free. See the
// block in globals.css for why the accent has to flip too.
//
// THE SECTION THAT USED TO BE #institutional IS NOW THIS. On the single-page site
// the three institutional statements were a card two thirds of the way down, and
// the footer beneath it was a wordmark and a URL. Folding one into the other is
// what the multi-page structure asks for: the statements have to reach a reader
// who lands on /projects from a maintainer's link and never sees the home page,
// and chrome is the only thing that reaches everyone. No content was dropped in
// the merge — the three statements, the email CTA, the page list and the
// trademark note are all still here, laid out as four columns instead of a card.

            data-reveal-group, and a footer is none of those, so four columns and
            eight links simply appeared. The stagger groups here are the whole fix:
            they are read from the document rather than from main, so marking the
