// The club in numbers.
//
// Every figure is DERIVED from the content arrays rather than typed here, so the
// strip cannot drift from the evidence on the other pages. There is no second place
// to edit and therefore nothing to forget to update — which is the only reason a
// summary band like this is safe on a site that promises its claims are checkable.
//
// AND IT HIDES ITS OWN ZEROES. A four-tile strip reading "1 project · 0 selections ·
// 0 members" is a worse first impression than no strip at all, and worse than the
// truth: it reads as a dead club rather than a new one. So a metric with nothing
// behind it does not render, and if fewer than two survive, the whole band is
// replaced by a panel that says plainly what will appear here and why it is empty.
//
// That honest-empty state is not a placeholder to be removed later. It is what the
// band does whenever the data thins out — if half the club graduates and the numbers
// drop, this degrades gracefully instead of shipping a lie.

              reason spelled out at the head of CountUp: a figure that behaves
              exactly like the sentence under it gives a reader scanning the strip
              no reason to stop at it. These six are the whole argument of this
              band, and they were the last display-size numbers on the site still
              arriving as static text.

              The count is on the same terms as everywhere else: the server renders
              the real number and script only ever takes it away to count it back,
              so a bundle failure leaves the figures present rather than asserting
              zero.

              tabular-nums arrives WITH CountUp rather than being declined here.
              The note this replaces argued against it — these figures sit in
              separate tiles and do not align in a column, and equal-width digits
              at display size make a number look loose — and that was right for a
              static figure. It stops being right for a counting one: proportional
              digits change width as they cycle, so an uncounted 3 growing to 24
              visibly breathes and nudges its own label. CountUp sets it for
              exactly this reason. */}
