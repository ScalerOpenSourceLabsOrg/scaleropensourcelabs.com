// The finished profile, shown back to the member who filled it in.
//
// EXTRACTED FROM THE OLD JOIN GATE SO TWO SCREENS COULD NOT DRIFT. A copy of a component
// that maps stored codes back to labels is a copy that goes stale the first time somebody
// adds a hostel, so both screens were made to share this one.
//
// `tone` is what let the two screens frame the same facts differently, and it is the ONLY
// thing it changes:
//
//   "receipt"  — seconds after the first save. Leads with "that's you signed up", because
//                the reader's question is "did that work".
//   "record"   — any day after. Leads with the details themselves, because the reader
//                already knows it worked and came here to check or change something.
//
// ONLY "record" HAS A CALLER TODAY, and the reason is worth knowing before anyone deletes
// the other half or reaches for it. The receipt existed for the last step of /join while
// /join was the sign-up flow. It is the anonymous application form again, and the "did
// that work" moment moved with it — the sign-in gate owns its own done state now, with copy about
// an application in a queue rather than about a profile that saved.
//
// The receipt cannot simply be pointed at /dashboard instead: the only first-save moment
// left there renders inside the full dashboard, under a heading that has already greeted
// the member by name, and "that's you signed up" under "Good to see you, Prateek" tells
// somebody who joined in March that they have just arrived. That is the same reason the
// record tone does not carry the line — see the note further down.
//
// `isAdmin` and `onSignOut` are in the same position: both were the receipt's, because
// /join was once the only screen an organiser reached before they knew the dashboard
// existed. They are kept rather than pruned because the props are load-bearing the moment
// a first-save screen wants its own framing again, and because a component that renders a
// member's whole record is the wrong place to be churning an API for tidiness.
//
// It deliberately does NOT own the edit form. `onEdit` is a callback, so the page decides
// what editing looks like — the dashboard swaps this card for the form within its own
// panel. A card that mounted ProfileForm itself would force every caller to agree.
