// The team, as an actual org chart.
//
// WHY A CHART AND NOT A GRID
// A grid of faces answers "who is important". A chart answers "who do I ask",
// which is the only question a reader of this section actually has. The club's
// functional leads have genuinely different remits — if you want your PR reviewed
// you want the Repo Maintainer, not the President — and a flat grid destroys
// exactly that information. So the structure is the content here, and the lines
// are load-bearing rather than decorative.
//
// WHY THE GRID HAS NO GAP
// This is the one decision the whole component rests on, so it is worth stating
// plainly: `grid-cols-N` with NO gap, and the visual separation comes from padding
// inside each cell instead.
//
// The reason is that every connector is positioned as a percentage of the grid's
// width, and those percentages are only exact when the columns tile the container
// with nothing between them. With a gap, a column's centre is
// `c/2 + i*(c+g)` — a function of the gap, which is itself a function of the
// breakpoint — so a line at `left: 12.5%` would sit a few pixels off its card, in
// a direction and by an amount that changes as the window resizes. That is the
// classic way a hand-built org chart ends up with connectors that visibly miss.
// Zero gap makes the arithmetic exact and viewport-independent:
//
//   3 leads  ->  lead cards centred at 16.67 / 50 / 83.33 %
//                officers straddling the seams between them, at 33.33 / 66.67 %
//
// And the fact that makes the hardest connector possible: an officer's centre
// always lands on a lead-column BOUNDARY. So the dashed line from the Vice
// President down to their shadow two tiers below drops perfectly straight and
// passes BETWEEN the Repo Maintainer and Events Lead cards without touching
// either. No elbows, no routing.
//
// That invariant is why the grid is measured in units FINER than one lead column
// (see LEAD_SPAN below) rather than one-column-per-lead: an officer centred on a
// seam needs to start half a lead-column early, which is only an integer number of
// tracks if a lead column is itself several tracks wide. The old version divided
// the column count by the officer count instead, which produced `span 1.5` — and
// therefore a silently broken row — the moment the lead count stopped being even.
//
// WHY SHADOW LINES ARE DASHED
// A shadow is not a subordinate — it is an understudy for one specific role. Those
// are different relationships, so they get different strokes, and the difference
// also resolves the one place the two kinds of line must cross (the VP's shadow
// line crosses the leads' horizontal rail). A dashed line crossing a solid one
// reads as two relationship types; two solid lines crossing reads as a mistake.
//
// The relationship is never carried by the line ALONE, though — each shadow card
// names its role in text ("Shadow — Vice President"). A reader on a phone gets the
// stacked list instead of the chart, and a screen reader gets only that list, so
// the geometry has to be a redundant encoding of something already written down.
//
// WHY A DESK IS NOT A FOURTH ROW OF THE SAME KIND
// Under the leads there is one more shape: a desk — several people doing one job
// together under a lead, with no office between them. It is drawn as a band below
// the shadow tier: a drop from the lead, a label naming the desk, then a rail out
// to a circle per member. The label is the point. Four unlabelled faces hanging off
// the Repo Maintainer would read as four more shadows, and the difference between
// "training to take this role" and "does this work" is exactly the sort of thing a
// chart is supposed to make visible. The members' circles carry no designation for
// the same reason — the label above them already says it, once, for all four.
//
// Zero JavaScript: no state, no measurement, no canvas. Server component.

   Four members do not divide COLS into integers, and every connector on this

   a `repeat(n, 1fr)` grid that spans all COLS at zero gap puts a member's centre
   at `(i + 0.5)/n` of the SAME box the outer percentages resolve against — so it
   stays exact for any number of members, without forcing LEAD_SPAN up to a
   multiple of the desk size.

   The drop is SOLID, not dashed: dashed is spoken for, and the key at the foot
   of this section defines it as "shadow". A desk reports to the lead; it is not
   training to replace them.
