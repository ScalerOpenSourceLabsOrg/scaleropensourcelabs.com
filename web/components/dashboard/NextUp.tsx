// opens it has nowhere to go. This is the only panel on the page with an outbound door.
//
// IT IS BUILT FROM CONTENT, NOT FROM FIRESTORE. The route they picked and the programmes
// they ticked are already on the profile, and everything this panel says about them
// already exists in content/join.ts and content/club.ts. So there is nothing to fetch,
// nothing to keep in sync, and no new collection — the personalisation is a lookup.
//
// WHY THE FIRST LINE NAMES THEIR ROUTE. "Here are some links" is a panel every member
// scrolls past. "You said fast-track, so here is the fast-track door" is the club having
// remembered — which is the whole difference between a dashboard and a footer.
