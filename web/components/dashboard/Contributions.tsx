// What GitHub says the member has been doing.
//
// FIVE STATES, and the four that are not "here are your numbers" are the ones that
// decide whether this panel is useful or insulting:
//
//   no handle        they never gave one. Ask for it, link to the edit form. Do NOT
//                    render zeroes — a panel that says "0 merged" to somebody who never
//                    told us where to look is accusing them of nothing.
//   never synced     handle given, the function has not run for them yet. Say that, and
//                    offer the button.
//   handle not found GitHub answered and there is no such account. Almost always a typo,
//                    so the copy says so and points at the field.
//   stale handle     they changed the handle after the last sync, so these numbers are
//                    the old account's. Flagged rather than silently shown.
//   synced           the numbers.
//
// THE NUMBERS ARE NOT A SCORE, and the copy has to keep saying that. A dashboard that
// ranks members by merged PRs turns a club whose entire pitch is "you do not need to be
// good yet" into a leaderboard that a first-year loses. So: no comparison to anybody
// else, no target, no streak. It is a record of your own work, and the empty version of
// it says "nothing yet" in the same voice as the full one.
//
// WHY THE HANDLE IS NOT PROOF. `github` is free text somebody typed into a form, so this
// panel shows activity for a HANDLE, not for a verified identity. The heading says so.
// See lib/contributions.ts for why verifying it is not worth a second sign-in.
