// One card on the dashboard, with the header treatment every panel in the design shares:
// an accent-tinted icon, a mono uppercase title, and an optional action at the right.
//
// EXTRACTED BECAUSE FIVE PANELS HAD THE SAME HEADER AND WOULD HAVE DRIFTED. The heading in
// the design is not the display face the rest of the site uses for headings — it is the
// mono label face at an unusually large size, which is what makes a panel read as part of
// an instrument rather than as a section of an article. That is a distinctive enough
// choice that five hand-copied versions of it would end up as five slightly different
// sizes, and the difference would be visible because the panels sit in one column.
//
// `tone` exists for the one panel the design fills solid — "Where to go next" is a block
// of accent blue with white type on it, and it is the only coloured surface on the page.
// Everything on it therefore has to take its colour from the same set, which is why the
// tone is a property of the PANEL rather than a class the caller adds: a caller that
// styled its own children for the blue ground would get it wrong in dark mode, where the
// accent is a pale periwinkle and black type is what reads on it.
