// The notice board, as a member reads it.
//
// THE ONE THING ON THIS DASHBOARD THAT CHANGES WITHOUT THE MEMBER DOING ANYTHING, which
// is why it sits at the top of the column rather than under the profile: a member who
// opens the dashboard twice in a week has already read their own details, and the only
// reason to come back is to find out what the club has said since.
//
// NO MARKDOWN, NO HTML, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. The body renders as plain text with
// `whitespace-pre-line`, so paragraph breaks survive and nothing else does. Rendering
// organiser-typed markup would mean either shipping a sanitiser or trusting that no
// admin account is ever compromised — and the value of bold text in a club notice is not
// worth either. A single optional link covers the real need, and the rules force it to
// be https.
//
// READ ONCE PER MOUNT. A board that polls spends reads to tell somebody nothing changed;
// the club posts a few times a week and the reader is going to reload anyway.

                 salmon is not in this site's palette, and adding a colour for one card is
                 how a palette stops being one. At 12% the yellow reads as the warm plate
