// The app shell: the chrome that both the member dashboard and the organisers' page sit
// inside, taken from the Stitch designs.
//
// TWO SCREENS, ONE SHELL. The admin design and the member design are the same frame with
// different content in the middle — same bar, same sidebar, same footer — so building it
// twice would guarantee they drift the first time either moves. The page supplies its own
// content and nothing else.
//
// IT REPLACES THE MARKETING CHROME RATHER THAN SITTING INSIDE IT. The site's nav is a
// floating rounded plate with six links arguing for the club; every reader here has
// already joined. See components/ChromeGate.tsx for the suppression, and app/layout.tsx
// for where it is applied.
//
// THE SIDEBAR'S FOUR ITEMS ARE NOT FOUR ROUTES, and that is the one place this deviates
// from the design. Only /dashboard exists as a page; the design shows Pull Requests,
// Projects and Settings as siblings of it. Rather than ship three dead links or three
// empty pages, each points at the thing it actually names: Pull Requests and Settings
// scroll to the panels that hold them, Projects goes to the site's own projects page.
// They are marked with `anchor` below so that turning any of them into a real route later
// is a one-line change here and nothing else.

 *  item that, being the page you are already on, does nothing when pressed. The loudest
 *  object in the sidebar was the one dead link in it.
 *
 *  So the current page is not styled differently; it is simply not listed. The sidebar
 *  says where you can go, and the app bar above already says where you are. */
/* NO `.tap` ON THESE ROWS, AND THAT IS THE FIX RATHER THAN A REGRESSION.
 *
 *  `.tap` is for a STANDALONE INLINE LINK: 14px of block padding with a matching -14px
 *  margin, so the hit area grows to the 44px floor and nothing on screen moves. It works
 *  because an inline link has no visible box — there is nothing to see growing.
 *
 *  These rows have one. They are `rounded-tile` with `hover:bg-sunk`, so the padding
 *  `.tap` adds is PAINTED, and the negative margin then pulls the next row up into it.
 *  Measured on /dashboard at 1440x900: "Projects" occupied y 161-213 and "My details"
 *  y 191-243 — a 22px overlap, in which the top of one row sits inside the click target
 *  of the row above it. A pointer near that boundary follows the wrong link, and the
 *  hover fill lights up a row you are not on.
 *
 *  So the row IS the target instead: py-3 on a 24px line box is 48px, clear of the 44px
 *  floor (WCAG 2.5.5) with no negative margin, and the fill it paints is exactly the
 *  area you can press. The sidebar's rows are 48px tall in layout rather than 24px,
 *  which is the honest height they were already claiming from the pointer.
 *
 *  `npm run qa` reports this as `tap-margin-clash`, which is what found it. */
