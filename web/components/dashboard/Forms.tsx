// What the club is asking this member to answer.
//
// FORMS AND POLLS RENDER THROUGH THE SAME COMPONENT because they are the same thing —
// see lib/forms.ts. `show_tally` decides whether the counts come back after answering,
// and nothing else differs.
//
// THE TALLY IS SHOWN ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE ANSWERED, and that is a deliberate choice rather
// than a technical limit. Seeing "14 people said Saturday" before you pick is an
// invitation to agree with the room, which is exactly what a poll is trying not to
// measure. Afterwards it is information; before, it is pressure.
//
// ANSWERS ARE NOT ANONYMOUS AND THE PANEL SAYS SO, once, plainly. A member filling in
// "which slot suits you" should know the organisers can see it was them — that is the
// point, since somebody has to chase the people who did not answer. Hiding that would be
// the one dishonest thing this screen could do.
//
// ONE READ PER FORM FOR THE MEMBER'S OWN ANSWER. The alternative is a collection-group
// query, which members are not allowed to run and should not be — it would mean reading
// other people's responses and filtering client-side.
