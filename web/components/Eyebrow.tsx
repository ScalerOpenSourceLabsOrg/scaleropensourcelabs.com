// The tiny coloured tag above a card headline.
//
// Apple uses these to flag state — NEW in orange, LIMITED TIME in red, Free
// Engraving in orange — sitting above the card's title in 11-12px uppercase.
//
// Two rules kept from the palette's discipline:
//   * `ember` is the site's single signal colour and appears almost nowhere else,
//     so it is reserved for the tag that genuinely needs urgency (a security fix).
//   * colour never carries meaning alone — the label text always says what the
//     state is, so a colourblind reader loses nothing.
