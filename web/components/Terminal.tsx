// A terminal block.
//
// The motif is doing a job rather than signalling "developer aesthetic": the
// commands in it are the real, working commands for the club's own repository, so
// the block is simultaneously the page's visual texture and the thing a reader
// copies into their shell. That is why it is built from <pre><code> rather than
// styled divs — the text has to survive being selected and pasted, with the
// prompts excluded from the copy.
//
// Excluding the prompt from what gets copied is the detail that makes it usable.
// A `$` glued to the front of the command is the oldest paper cut in developer
// documentation; `user-select: none` on the prompt span means a reader can drag
// across three lines and paste three runnable commands.
//
// The window chrome is three dots and a title, and they are aria-hidden: a screen
// reader announcing "circle circle circle" before every code block is pure noise.
// The <pre> carries the accessible name instead.
