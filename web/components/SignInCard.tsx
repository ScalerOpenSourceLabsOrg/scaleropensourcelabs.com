// SIGN-IN. Its own feature, on its own card, answering exactly one question: is this
// person a student at this college.
//
// IT USED TO BE STEP ONE OF THE JOIN FORM, and pulling it out is the point of this file
// rather than a tidy-up. On /join it stood in front of the application form, so a
// stranger could not apply to the club without already holding a college Google account
// — which inverted the club's own front door and contradicted the headline beside it.
// Joining is sign-in only (components/JoinGate.tsx on /join) and this card guards only the
// members' area, which is the one thing that genuinely needs to know who you are.
//
// WHAT WENT WITH THE SPLIT, and why its absence is correct:
//
//   THE STEP SPINE. This card carried an "01 Sign in / 02 Your details" spine, because
//   it was the first half of a two-step signup. There is no step two here any more —
//   signing in is a single act with a single outcome, and a spine numbering one step is
//   a progress indicator that only ever says "you are at the beginning of nothing". The
//   profile form it used to lead to is now reached from the dashboard, which shows its
//   own state without needing to count.
//
// WHAT DELIBERATELY STAYED:
//
//   THE DOMAIN, ON A RULE. A hairline with the domain sitting in the break of it: the
//   loudest colour on the site spent on the shortest possible string, which is the one
//   string a reader cannot afford to skim past. It replaced a full yellow panel saying
//   the same thing in three lines — the panel was carrying the explanation as well as
//   the fact, and the explanation belongs in the box below it, which is built to hold it.
//
//   THE CARD'S QUIET EDGE. It keeps `.card`'s pale border and diffuse shadow rather than
//   a black keyline, because this stylesheet's rule is that controls get the hard shadow
//   and content panels do not — "if everything wore the hard shadow the page would be a
//   wall of outlines with nothing to press". The button is the only thing here you can
//   press, so it is the only thing wearing the keyline.
//
// THIS IS NOT A PRIVILEGE GATE. Anybody can fetch the page this renders on and read its
// markup; the site is a static export and there is no server to refuse them. What refuses
// a stranger is firestore.rules. See the header of lib/auth.tsx before concluding that a
// hidden page on this site is a safe one.

 *
 *  The hard shadow marks a CONTROL in this stylesheet — "controls get a black keyline
 *  and an unblurred shadow, content panels get a pale border and a diffuse one" — so two
 *  identical objects where exactly one is pressable is the ambiguity that rule exists to
 *  prevent. The keyline keeps the plate loud; the shadow belongs to the button alone.

      {/* NOT DISABLED WHILE BUSY, AND THAT IS THE FIX RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.
          signInWithPopup does not reject promptly when somebody closes the Google window —
          it polls for closure, and measured here it took five to seven seconds to settle.
          A `disabled={busy}` therefore left the only control on the card dead for seven
          seconds after the reader closed the chooser to pick a different account, which is
          well past the point where somebody decides the site is broken and reloads.
          Clearing `busy` on window focus was tried first and abandoned: the focus event
          never arrived when the popup closed, so the fix could not be verified, and
          unverifiable code is worse than none.
          Leaving it pressable is safe because the code below already anticipates a second
          press — `auth/cancelled-popup-request` is one of the two codes the error handler
          swallows deliberately. Firebase cancels the stale attempt and opens a fresh
          chooser, which is exactly what the reader is asking for.
