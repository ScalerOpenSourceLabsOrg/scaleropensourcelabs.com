// "Organisers only", in one place.
//
// The organisers' area was one route with six panels on it, each carrying its own copy of
// this check and its own wording for the refusal. It is seven routes now, so the copy
// would have been seven copies — and the one that drifts is the one that tells somebody
// they are not an organiser in a slightly different voice from the last page they tried.
//
// IT IS NOT A PRIVILEGE BOUNDARY, and nothing about it should be mistaken for one. Every
// admin route is static HTML on a CDN and anybody can fetch it. What refuses them is the
// `list` rule on users/, the admin-only writes on every collection these pages touch, and
// the `admins` membership check the rules do on each request — none of which a client can
// talk its way past. This decides what to PAINT. If you ever move the membership test out
// of firestore.rules and into this file, you have removed the security.
//
// THREE STATES, and the middle one matters. `isAdmin === undefined` means the check is
// still in flight — showing the refusal during it tells every organiser they are not one,
// for as long as the read takes, on every load.
