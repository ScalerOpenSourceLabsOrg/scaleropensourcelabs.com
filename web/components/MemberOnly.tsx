// The three states that come before "signed in", in one place, because /onboarding and
// /dashboard both have them and two copies would drift.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY, and nothing about it should ever be mistaken for
// one. The site is a static export: every route's HTML is on the CDN and anybody can
// fetch it, signed in or not. What this component does is decide what to PAINT. What
// refuses to hand over data is firestore.rules, and only that. If you find yourself
// reasoning "the page is hidden, so the data is safe", read the note at the top of
// lib/auth.tsx first — it is the same trap, written down before it was fallen into.
//
// THE ORDER OF THE BRANCHES IS THE WHOLE POINT. `user === undefined` means the session is
// still being restored, and it has to be its own state rather than folded into "signed
// out". A static route ships before auth resolves, so treating unknown as signed-out
// means every returning member sees a sign-in prompt flash before their own page. That
// is the specific bug the single-component JoinGate was built to avoid, and splitting the
// flow across routes brings it back unless every route is careful. This is where the care
// lives.
