// The mid-page banner strip.
//
// Theirs sits between sections: a cream band, a line of condensed caps with the
// load-bearing phrase in blue and a hand-drawn underline beneath it, a doodle either
// side, and the yellow offset-shadow button on the right.
//
// It earns its place on a page this long for a reason the sticky bar does not cover.
// The sticky bar is an ever-present option a reader learns to ignore; this is a
// deliberate stop placed at the one point where the argument has just finished —
// you have read how a first contribution actually goes, so this is where "start
// one" lands. A banner in the wrong place is an advert. In the right place it is a
// conclusion.
//
// Placed after the path section for exactly that reason.
//
// It states no figure and makes no claim, so there is nothing here to source. The
// one number on the page that matters is already above it.
