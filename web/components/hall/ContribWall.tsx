// The green wall — a GitHub-style contribution grid under the hall, with OPEN
// SOURCE burned into it in dark cells.
//
// THIS IS TEXTURE, AND IT IS BUILT SO IT CANNOT BE MISREAD AS DATA. That
// distinction is the only interesting thing about the component, so it is worth
// being explicit about how it is enforced:
//
//   * The word IS the disclaimer now, and it is a better one than the caption
//     that used to sit up there reading "decorative · not a real contribution
//     graph". Real activity does not spell things. A wall that reads OPEN SOURCE
//     admits in the graphic itself that somebody arranged these cells, so the old
//     caption was explaining a joke the picture already tells. The line in its
//     place is a reading instruction rather than a disclaimer — squinting drops
//     the faint texture out and leaves the dark cells, which is genuinely how the
//     word resolves fastest.
//
//   * It carries NO counts, NO month or weekday axis, NO legend and NO tooltip.
//     A grid of green squares is a visual idiom; it only becomes a chart when
//     something around it claims the squares mean something. Add a "1,204
//     contributions this year" caption and this stops being decoration and starts
//     being a figure nobody measured.
//
//   * It is NOT per-student. One wall under the whole grid reads as a section
//     motif; a strip behind each card would read as that person's activity, and
//     none of these students has activity data recorded anywhere in this repo.
//
//   * The pattern is DETERMINISTIC, from a tiny integer hash rather than
//     Math.random(). Random would differ between the server render and the client
//     hydration — React would warn, and one of the two would be discarded and
//     repainted. It also means the wall looks the same on every load, which is
//     what a background texture should do.
//
// aria-hidden and role-free: there is nothing here to announce. The word is
// decoration, not content — the section around it says "open source" in real text
// several times over, so a screen reader loses nothing by never hearing about it.
// The caption stays inside the hidden subtree even though it is now the loudest
// thing in the block, and on purpose: "close your eyes 70%" is an instruction for
// looking at a picture, so it is meaningless to a reader who is not.

            left.

            A CHIP rather than the 11px mono grey it started as. That treatment is
            the page's convention for a footnote nobody needs to read, and it was
            doing its job too well — --dust on --raise is deliberately the quietest
            pair in the system, so the one line telling you there is a word in the
            grid was the line least likely to be seen. A hint that goes unread is
            just clutter.

            IT WAS MINT, matching the wall's own green so that the caption and the
            thing it is about read as one object. That argument was sound and the
            colour did not survive the palette pass: decorative mint was one of the
            fills that made the site's stationery drawer wider than its ink, and it
            is now reserved for the places where the colour is the argument — the
            "OSC way" / "Old way" pair. The default blue chip carries this instead,
            and the tilt below is doing the work the colour was.

            TILTED, so no .chip-true here: the tilt is what separates a label the
            site applied to itself from a badge asserting a fact, and a straight pill
            next to a grid of green squares is exactly the "this is data" reading the
            whole component is built to avoid. */}

      {/* FLUID CELLS, which is what makes the wall run the whole length of its
          panel. It used to size each cell at a fixed 0.625rem, and 52 of those
          plus gaps comes to about 676px — so inside an 88rem container the grid
          stopped a little past halfway and left the rest of the panel empty,
          with the word bunched into the left half of it.

          So the columns are fractions of the container instead of a measurement,
          and the cells take their height from their own width via aspect-square.
          The wall is then exactly as wide as the panel at every breakpoint, the
          52-week shape is preserved, and the cell size is whatever that implies —
          around 22px on a wide screen, around 6px on a phone.

          This also retires the horizontal scroll this needed while the cells were
          fixed: nothing overflows any more, so nothing has to be scrolled to or
          cropped, and the full word is visible at every width. */}
