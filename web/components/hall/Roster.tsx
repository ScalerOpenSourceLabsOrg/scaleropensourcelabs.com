// The scannable roster that sits under the solar system.
//
// The system is a good hook and a bad index. Somebody evaluating this club — a
// maintainer, a sponsor, a student comparing options — will not scroll through
// fourteen viewport-height stations to find out how many people got into GSoC and
// with which organisations. They want the list, sorted, in one screen.
//
// So the metaphor is demoted to what it is good at (making you stop) and the facts
// live here in a table you can read in five seconds, copy out of, and link to. That
// split is the point: spectacle above, evidence below.
//
// This also carries the whole section for anyone the WebGL never reaches — reduced
// motion, no GPU, a locked-down browser, or a search crawler.

      {/* The table now sits in its own tile rather than floating on the page.
          Two nested elements and each does one job: the outer card owns the
          border, the radius and the shadow with `overflow-hidden` so the corners
          actually clip the header row, and the inner div owns the horizontal
          scroll. Merging them would put `overflow-x: auto` on the rounded box,
          and a scroll container cannot clip its own rounded corners — the
          left-hand cells would square off the moment the table was wider than
          the card, which is the only state that matters on a phone.

          card-still, not card: a shadow that lifts under the pointer is an
          affordance, and this tile is not clickable. The rows have their own
          hover.

          The `min-w-[42rem]` on the table is what forces that scroll on narrow
          screens; five columns of names and organisations do not compress. */}

              then shares out the slack evenly, so at 1280px "GSoC", "2026" and a
              name each sat in the middle of its own gulf with the em dashes
              marooned at the right — a table twice as wide as its content and
              half as readable. The whole point of this pass is density.

              The percentages are weighted to what actually varies: names and
              organisations are long and unpredictable, programme codes and years
              are four characters and fixed. */}

              in two places, which would drift the moment a column is added.
