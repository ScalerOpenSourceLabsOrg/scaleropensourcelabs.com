// The hall: every student who was selected, as a grid of cards.
//
// This replaced a WebGL solar system in which each selection was an orbiting
// planet and a rocket flew past them on scroll. The 3D is gone at the client's
// instruction, and the honest accounting is that it cost about a thousand lines,
// a 15,000px section, a three.js dependency, and a scroll mechanic that could
// only ever be verified by rendering it — to say one thing: these people got in.
//
// It went through a one-per-row feature layout in between, which was a mistake worth
// recording: at 440px a portrait plus its text filled a viewport, so seeing fourteen
// people meant scrolling fourteen screens. That buries the very argument the count
// is making. A grid says "these are all of them" at a glance.
//
// Still ZERO JavaScript — no state, no scroll listener, no canvas — so this stays a
// server component and the whole section is HTML and CSS.
//
// There are deliberately no 01/02/03 markers. Order carries no meaning in a list
// of people — numbering them would imply a ranking that does not exist, which is
// the exact thing the client removed the leaderboard to avoid.

// THE CARD HEADINGS ARE h2 AND WERE h3, and the reason is not inside this file.
//
// On the single-page site the hall was one section among fourteen, its own heading
// was an h2 under the page's h1, and h3 on each card was correct. The hall is now
// its own route: its section heading IS the page title and was promoted to h1, so
// h3 on the cards left an h1 → h3 jump with nothing at h2 between them. A screen
// reader navigating by heading level reports that as a missing level and the reader
// has no way to tell whether they skipped something.
//
// Caught by the heading-order check in scripts/qa.mjs, which is the only thing on
// this project that would have. Nothing renders differently — these carry their own
// size and weight and never relied on the tag.
//
// If this component is ever mounted under a page that already has an h1 and a
// section h2, these need to go back to h3.

          The one-per-row feature layout showed one person per viewport — fourteen
          screens to see fourteen people, which buries the argument the count is
          making. A grid says "these are all of them" in a glance, which is the
          whole point of the section.

          Chrome-less cards, taken from apple.com/store: their product cards
          measure transparent background, no border, no radius — the image IS the
          card, and the surrounding box is what makes a grid look templated. So the
          portrait carries the tile radius and the text sits beneath it in open
          space rather than inside a panel.

          Hover lifts the card on their measured curve — transform 0.3s
          cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.5, 1) — and only at the pointer, never on touch.

          FOUR across at the top end, per the client, down from five. The row is
          the unit of reading here and four is the count that still divides cleanly
          into the list while giving each card room: at the 76rem container, four
          columns is roughly 265px a card against five columns' 208px, which is the
          difference between a two-word name setting on one line at display-md and
          setting on two. There is no xl step any more — lg is the top of the
          ladder, so the grid stops widening once the cards are comfortable rather
          than adding a column the moment the window allows one.
          The ladder below it steps one column at a time — a two-column jump halves
          the card width in a single breakpoint and the text visibly reflows as the
          window resizes. Mobile stays at one, unchanged: two 155px cards side by
          side is where the name and the work sentence stop being readable at all. */}

                    in PROJECTS, with figures read from the GitHub API — and the

                    that could actually cost somebody something if a maintainer
                    went looking.

                  the electric-blue sticker the section eyebrows wear — this one is a fact
                  about a person rather than a label the site applied to itself,
                  and against a photograph's straight edge a tilt would read as a
                  misalignment rather than as a sticker.

                  THE ORG SITS ON THIS ROW, beside the programme, because it is half
                  of the same fact — "GSoC 2026" says which programme, the org says
                  who inside it actually picked them, and the two read as one
                  credential. It was briefly on the mono line below the name, next to
                  the year of study, which put the organisation in with the small
                  subordinate facts and left the credential looking finished without
                  it.

                  It is NOT a second .chip. That class is 14px bold uppercase with
                  0.1em tracking; a second one of those at this width competes with
                  the violet badge for the same job and the pair reads as two
                  credentials rather than one. Mono and quiet is the same treatment
                  the repo names on the projects page get — a machine-ish fact
                  attached to a human one.

                  ALWAYS RENDERED, even when the org is unknown, which is a change
                  from "a missing org renders as nothing". Every card in this cohort
                  is missing it, so rendering nothing meant the wall never answered
                  the question a reader asks straight after the programme. The slot
                  holds its place and says it is empty.

                  It says "org TBA" rather than naming a plausible foundation, and it
                  wears a dashed keyline so it cannot be misread as an org called
                  that. club.ts's rule is unchanged: a missing org must never render
                  as a wrong one. A slot that admits it is empty is not a claim. Fill
                  `org` in club.ts's cohort tuples and the placeholder is replaced per
                  person, with no edit here.

                  "org TBA" AND NOT "org to be announced", which is the phrase this
                  started as, and the reason is measured rather than stylistic. The
                  space left beside the violet chip is 188px at the 4-column top end
                  but only 92px at 1024 and 107px at 820 — the spelt-out phrase is
                  178px and wrapped to its own line at every width below the widest,
                  turning a 27px row into 59px and leaving the pill orphaned under
                  the badge it was meant to sit beside. "org TBA" is 77px and fits
                  everywhere. Anything longer than about 90px will wrap again.

                  A long REAL org — "The Linux Foundation" measures 186px — will
                  wrap here too, and that is the acceptable half of the trade: by
                  then the row is carrying a fact worth a second line, not a note
                  saying there is nothing to show. */}

            done. This
            one card says the list is still being written, and it is the only card here
            that is an invitation rather than evidence.

            So it is the only one in yellow. #FFD600 is the page's primary-action
            colour — the apply button wears it, the marker badges wear it, nothing else
            does — and spending it once at the end of a wall of photographs is what
            makes the card read as a call to act rather than as a sixteenth person.

            Rendered outside the map on purpose: it is not a Selection, it has no
            programme, year, org or proof link, and threading a synthetic entry through
            `people` would mean every consumer of that array — the count above, the
            roster table, selectionStats — having to know to skip it. The count would
            have said sixteen.

            The whole card is one <a> to #apply rather than a card with a link inside
            it: there is no second thing to click here, and a 265px yellow tile that
            does nothing when pressed is worse than no tile. That is also why the
            action row below is a <span> — an <a> inside an <a> is invalid and browsers
            recover from it by splitting the outer link. */}

            {/* Same frame as a portrait — the `card` border, the `tilt` hover, the
                4/5 aspect and the panel radius — so the slot sits in the grid rhythm
                instead of beside it. Only the fill changes.

                bg-pop as a utility works here because `.card` deliberately sets no
                background (see globals.css); a `background` on that class would
                silently beat this, which is the trap the class comment names.

                The ring, not a border utility: `.card`'s `border` shorthand is emitted
                after Tailwind's utilities and would win, so the keyline that separates
                a bright yellow field from a pale page has to come from a property the
                card does not own. Same trick Portrait uses on its monogram field. */}
