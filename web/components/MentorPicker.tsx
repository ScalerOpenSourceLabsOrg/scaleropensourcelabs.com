// GSoC mentorship: enrol, and say which mentor you want.
//
// NOT components/Mentors.tsx. That is the public marketing section, hard-coded in
// content/club.ts and consent-gated. This is the signed-in half — mentors an organiser
// publishes from the dashboard, and the preferences members record against them.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE ASK. A first choice, and then exactly one of two things: a second
// choice, or "first preference only". Those are different statements and the form makes
// the reader pick one rather than inferring from an empty field — somebody who has not
// decided about a second mentor and somebody who has decided they want one mentor look
// identical in the data otherwise, and an organiser pairing thirty students needs to tell
// them apart. firestore.rules enforces the same thing, in both directions.
//
// ONE CHOICE PER SCREEN, and this replaced both lists being on the page at once. With
// everything visible the reader met the same mentors twice, stacked, with a checkbox
// wedged between the two copies — so the page was long, the second list looked like a
// duplicate of the first, and the relationship between the checkbox and the list below it
// had to be worked out. Splitting it means each screen asks one question with the full
// set of answers in front of it, and the second screen can be built out of what the first
// one decided: the mentor you already picked is not offered again, and "no second choice"
// becomes one of the options rather than a modifier attached to the list.
//
// THE "NO SECOND CHOICE" OPTION IS A CARD IN THE SAME GROUP, not a checkbox beside it.
// That is what makes step two always answerable in exactly one action, and it is why
// `first_only` can be a real decision in the data rather than an absence.
//
// NO CAPACITY, DELIBERATELY. Mentors have no slot count and a popular mentor is not shown
// as full. Two reasons: a slot counter turns choosing a mentor into a race, which is a bad
// first experience of a club whose whole argument is that it is not a competition; and the
// pairing is done by a human at the end anyway, so a limit enforced here would only be a
// limit enforced twice, inconsistently. What the organisers get instead is the demand
// numbers on their own dashboard.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. Nothing here allocates. A preference is a preference until an
// organiser says otherwise, and the copy says so — telling somebody they "have" a mentor
// because they picked one would be the same unearned claim the rest of this site refuses
// to make.
