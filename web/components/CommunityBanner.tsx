// The floating community call to action.
//
// Three zones on one line at lg — claim, action, faces — collapsing to a stack
// below that. The pale cobalt wash (#F0F6FF) is the one panel on the page that is
// neither white nor a band, which is what makes it read as floating on the
// section rather than being part of it.
//
// TWO THINGS THE BRIEF ASKED FOR THAT THIS DOES DIFFERENTLY, both for the same
// reason — the numbers and the faces have to be real:
//
//   1. "Join 300+ Contributors". There is no 300 anywhere in this repo, and no
//      field that could become one: the club records its published
//      selections (SELECTIONS in club.ts, and the count moves as names come in —
//      which is why it is not written out here), eight people running it, and
//      one project with an API-verified
//      merge count. A recruitment page for sixteen-year-olds that inflates its
//      community by twentyfold is the kind of claim that costs the club its
//      credibility the first time somebody counts. The label reads from
//      selectionStats() instead, so it grows on its own and cannot drift from the
//      hall below it.
//
//   2. The avatar stack is REAL PEOPLE — the first few published selections,
//      rendered through the same Portrait component the hall uses. A row of
//      generic stock headshots implying a membership that has not been counted is
//      the same fabrication as the number, just harder to notice.
//
// Nothing here renders if there is nobody to show. An empty avatar stack beside
// "join the club" is worse than no banner.
