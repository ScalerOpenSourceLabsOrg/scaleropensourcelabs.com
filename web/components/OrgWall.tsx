// Global representation, as a wall of organisation names.
//
// A MAP WAS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE AND IS THE WRONG ONE. The brief asks for "a map or a
// logo wall", and a world map with dots on it would be the least honest thing on the
// site: a handful of contributions renders as a nearly empty globe, which understates
// real work — and the moment you scale the dots so it looks respectable, you are
// drawing a picture of data you do not have. A named list with a link on each entry
// is duller and checkable, and it grows into something genuinely impressive on its
// own rather than being pre-inflated.
//
// AND THE LOGOS ARE TYPE, not images. Two reasons, either sufficient: an
// organisation's logo is its trademark and putting OWASP's mark on a club page
// implies an endorsement nobody granted; and the site's Content-Security-Policy
// allows `img-src 'self' data:`, so a remote logo would be blocked by the browser
// and render as a broken image. Set in mono inside a bordered plate, it reads as a
// deliberate treatment rather than a missing asset.
//
// GROUPED BY RELATION, which is the load-bearing decision. "Code merged upstream"
// and "alumni working there" are very different claims, and a single undifferentiated
// wall of names would let the weaker one borrow the strength of the stronger — the
// exact quiet inflation the content rules exist to prevent. A reader can see which
// is which without reading a caption.
