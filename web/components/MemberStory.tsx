// Member stories, as a rail of full-screen blue testimonial slides.
//
// This section used to render exactly one story, and the argument for that is
// still worth knowing: a row of quotes reads as marketing and gets discounted as
// a set, where one long account from a named person reads as somebody talking.
// Slides that each fill the viewport get most of that back — you are only ever
// looking at one person at a time. What keeps it honest is unchanged: a name, the
// situation at the time, a link to the thing being described where there is one,
// and the member's own words with nothing tidied into the site's voice.
//
// THERE IS NO PORTRAIT. It was a monogram disc for everybody, since none of these
// members has a photo on file, and a slide built around an empty frame advertises
// the missing photograph rather than the words next to it. The quote is the slide.
//
// ONE SLIDE IS EXACTLY ONE RAIL WIDTH, which is why the slides are `w-full` and
// not `w-screen`: a flex item's percentage width resolves against the flex
// container, so this tracks the scroller's own box. 100vw includes the vertical
// scrollbar gutter and would leave every slide a sliver wide of the viewport.
//
// IT ADVANCES A WHOLE SLIDE AT A TIME, and does not creep. The first version of
// this drifted continuously — a slow constant scroll — and that is the wrong
// motion for the content: a testimonial is one person's account, so it is either
// on screen or it is not, and text that never stops moving cannot be read at all.
// So the rail sits still for DWELL_MS, moves one slide, and sits still again.
// `scroll-snap-type` in globals.css holds a human drag to the same rule.
//
// THE LOOP IS TWO COPIES OF THE LIST, the same mechanic as `.ticker`. Advancing
// off the end of copy one lands on the identical slide in copy two, and the
// position is folded back by one turn once the animation settles — an instant
// jump between two pixel-identical states, so there is no seam to see. The wrap
// distance is measured off the DOM (the clone's first slide minus the real first
// slide) rather than computed from widths, so it stays exact at any viewport.
//
// STOPPING IT. Hover parks it, which is what was asked for. Focus parks it too,
// so a keyboard reaching the arrows or a link inside a slide is not reading a
// moving target, and a drag parks it until the finger is up. Leaving restarts the
// clock from a full dwell rather than resuming a part-spent one — being dropped
// onto the next person half a second after you look away is worse than waiting.
// There is no pause button by request; worth knowing that WCAG 2.2.2 asks for an
// explicit control over motion that runs for more than five seconds, so hover
// plus focus is the mitigation here rather than the answer. Under
// prefers-reduced-motion nothing advances on its own and the arrows jump instead
// of gliding, which leaves an ordinary snapping scroller.
