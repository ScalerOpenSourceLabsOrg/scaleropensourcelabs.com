// The two-tone section headline.
//
// The pattern started as apple.com's: an assertion in ink followed by its
// qualifier in grey, identical size and weight, only the colour changing. That
// split still does the real work here — one line carries claim and elaboration
// without needing a subtitle underneath, which is why a section heading can be
// long and conversational instead of a terse label.
//
// What changed for the notyourcollege.com direction is the two things the pattern
// is built from:
//
//   * The trail is BLUE, not grey. Grey reads as "less important, keep moving";
//     the brand blue reads as the second half of the same sentence. Same
//     structure, opposite energy, and it is the device their whole page runs on.
//
//   * The face is the display face at 800. It used to be the display face IN
//     CAPS, and the caps are gone — this is the one place the type change forces
//     a real decision rather than a substitution.
//
//     Anton is condensed, so a two-clause sentence in caps still fitted two lines
//     at display size; that is what made the caps affordable. Plus Jakarta Sans
//     sets the same sentence about 60% wider, so the longest heading here — "Most
//     students never apply because nobody told them these exist." — went to three
//     full lines of 44px capitals. That is a wall, and a wall of capitals is
//     precisely the register this pass exists to get rid of.
//
//     So the rule across the site is now: CAPS ONLY WHERE THE STRING IS A LABEL —
//     the hero's two words, a badge, a button — and sentence case everywhere a
//     heading is a piece of language. Weight and the two-tone split carry the
//     hierarchy the capitals were carrying, and they do it without the shouting.
//
// Structural, not decorative: `lead` is always the assertion and `trail` the
// elaboration. Reversing them makes the sentence read backwards.
//
// `text-balance` stays and matters as much as ever: a two-clause sentence left to
// break wherever it lands produces a very uneven rag at this size.

      {/* THE HAND-DRAWN RULE, ON THE PAGE'S PRIMARY HEADING AND NOTHING ELSE.
          It used to render under all 34 of these — every page title and every
          section heading on the site — and a mark that appears under everything
          marks nothing. It cost a real hierarchy: with the sub-page mastheads
          moved down to display-lg, a page title and the first section heading
          beneath it were the same size, the same black-and-blue, and both
          underlined, so there was no way to tell which was the page.
          Restricting it restores the distinction without a third heading size.
          It also gives the mark back its meaning: one drawn line per page, under
          the sentence the page is actually about.

          Rendered HERE rather than at each call site, so no page can forget it
          and none can drift to a different width — the same argument that put the
          caps rule in this component.

          Not inside the <Tag>: a heading's accessible name would then include an
          SVG, and more practically the underline has to sit below a heading that
          may be one line or three, which an inline element inside it cannot do.

          Fixed 7rem rather than the heading's width. A rule that stretches to the
          text is a border; one that runs a fixed distance from the left margin is
          a mark somebody drew.

          `draw` plots it stroke-first as the section arrives. This is the single
          best place on the page for that effect and close to the only defensible
          one: it is already the mark that says "a person made this", it appears
          exactly once per section, and a line that draws itself under a heading
          is doing the same job as the heading rather than competing with it. See
          the note on Doodle's `draw` prop for why it is not simply on by default. */}
      {/* INLINE-BLOCK, AND IT IS de-facto LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN COSMETIC.
          Tailwind's preflight sets `svg { display: block }`, so this rule ignored
          `text-align` entirely and pinned itself to the left edge of whatever
          contained it. In the thirteen left-aligned sections that is invisibly
          correct — left edge and text start are the same place. In the centred
          "Want your name in the commit log?" section it is not: the heading centred
          and the rule stayed at the far left of a full-width block, stranded about
          700px from the words it belongs to, reading as a stray blue mark rather
          than as an underline.
          inline-block makes it inherit the alignment of the section it is in, so
          the one centred section centres it and the left-aligned ones are unchanged
          — no prop, no call-site override, and no way for a future centred section
          to reintroduce the same orphan.
          `align-top` is the other half: preflight also sets `vertical-align: middle`
          on svg, and an inline-block sitting on the text baseline adds a descender's
          worth of line box under it, which would put a few stray pixels of gap below
          every section heading on the page. */}
      {/* w-36/h-3, up from w-28/h-2.5, and the number is derived rather than
          nudged. Their section headings carry `decoration-3` — a 3px rule — and
          this SVG has no stroke-width of its own to set: Doodle draws every path
          at 2.4 user units inside a 120-unit box, so the rendered thickness is
          whatever the element's width scales that to. At 112px it came out at
          2.24px, which is thinner than their hairline and read as a scratch under
          a heading rather than as a mark somebody made. 144px scales the same
          stroke to 2.88px, which lands on their 3px by construction.
          The LENGTH is still fixed rather than matched to the text — see the note
          above for why that distinction is the whole point of the device. */}
