// CURRENTLY UNMOUNTED. Kept, not deleted, and this note is here so the next reader
// does not spend ten minutes working out why nothing imports it.
//
// The argument below is entirely correct FOR A SINGLE-PAGE SITE, which is what this
// was written for. Its premise is stated in its own second paragraph: the form
// exists exactly once, 12,000px down. That premise is now false. /join is its own
// route, and the nav carries a filled Join button at every scroll position on every
// page — so this bar and that button would be two permanent controls firing the same
// action, and the bar would be the one a reader learns to ignore.
//
// It is worth keeping because the premise could come back: if the nav ever loses its
// button, or a single long landing page is added, this is a finished implementation
// of the pattern with all four of its rules already worked out. Re-mounting it means
// rendering <StickyCTA /> in app/layout.tsx and pointing its href at JOIN_HREF. The
// body-padding reservation it needs is still in globals.css, gated on the
// `[data-cta="1"]` attribute this component sets — so with it unmounted the
// attribute is never set and the reservation costs nothing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The persistent call to action — Apple's sticky buy bar, which is the single
// device that makes their product pages sell rather than merely describe.
//
// On a 26,000px page the join form exists exactly once. A reader who is convinced
// at the mentors section is 12,000px from the only place they can act, and asking
// them to scroll back is asking them to lose interest. This keeps the action one
// tap away from wherever conviction happens.
//
// Four rules, each of which is why the pattern is usually done badly:
//
// 1. It does not appear over the hero. The hero already carries both CTAs; a bar
//    repeating them on load is noise, and a page that starts by nagging reads as
//    desperate rather than confident.
//
// 2. It HIDES when the apply form is on screen. Pushing someone toward a form they
//    are already looking at is the clearest possible signal that nothing on the
//    page is paying attention to them.
//
// 3. It reserves its own space rather than covering the last section. A fixed bar
//    that permanently occludes the footer is a bug, not a CTA.
//
// 4. It states only what is true. If no cohort deadline is configured it says
//    nothing about timing — there is no invented countdown here, which is the
//    same rule the form itself follows.
