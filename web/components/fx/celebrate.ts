// The celebration: confetti plus a short chime, on the two moments that deserve
// one — a submitted application, and a click on the main call to action.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE DELIBERATE HERE AND EASY TO UNDO BY ACCIDENT.
//
// 1. canvas-confetti is loaded with a DYNAMIC IMPORT, at the moment of the first
//    burst, not at module scope. It is 7kB that only ever runs after a click, and
//    a static import would put it in the page's first-load bundle for every
//    reader including the ones who never press anything. It also touches
//    `document` on import, so a static import from a component that ever renders
//    on the server is a build-time crash waiting for someone to move a file.
//
// 2. REDUCED MOTION SUPPRESSES BOTH the confetti and the sound. The motion half is
//    obvious. The sound is a judgement call: prefers-reduced-motion is not a sound
//    preference and there is no standard one, but in practice the people who set
//    it are asking for less sensory load, and a surprise chime is exactly that. A
//    quiet page is a fine outcome; startling somebody is not.
//
// 3. The chime is SYNTHESISED, not a file. No asset to ship, no 404 to handle, no
//    format negotiation — and it can only ever play for ~120ms because that is
//    hard-coded into the envelope below. It also only ever runs inside a click
//    handler, so it can never trip an autoplay policy.
//
// Everything is wrapped so a failure is silent. A browser that refuses to build an
// AudioContext, or a blocked chunk fetch, must not take out the form submission
// this is decorating — the celebration is the least important thing on screen at
// the moment it fires.

/** The palette, in the page's own order of loudness: electric blue, the yellow,
    the merge-green, and the gradient's violet end. The lime that used to close
    this list went with the lime .chip — it belonged to no other surface once the
    badges turned blue, and four confetti colours where the page has three reads
    as one stray colour rather than as a fourth. */
