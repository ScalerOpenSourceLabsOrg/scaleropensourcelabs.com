// The sticky notes — squares of paper taped or pinned into the empty space
// beside a section.
//
// A server component, like Sticker beside it, and for the same reason: there is
// no state here. The whole behaviour is a tilt at rest and a peel on hover, and
// both are four lines of CSS (see .note in globals.css).
//
// This exists because there used to be exactly one of these, hand-written inline
// in page.tsx underneath a forty-line comment explaining the arithmetic that
// keeps it off the heading. That comment was right and had to survive, but a
// second note written from memory would have got the arithmetic wrong — so the
// arithmetic lives here now, in the one place every note passes through.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PLACEMENT. There are exactly two safe ways to put a note beside a section, and
// which one applies is decided by the section, not by taste.
//
//   place="gutter"  — for sections whose content fills the container. The note
//                     hangs OUTSIDE it, into the margin, and therefore only
//                     exists once that margin does.
//
//                     The arithmetic, since it is not guessable: `.section` caps
//                     at 88rem, so the gutter each side is (viewport - 1408) / 2.
//                     THE OFFSET IS THE NOTE'S OWN WIDTH — `-left-40`/`-right-40`
//                     against `w-40` — which puts it entirely outside the
//                     container, and the container's 24px of padding is then the
//                     whole of the clearance between it and the text.
//
//                     That 160px of gutter plus a margin first exists at about
//                     1760px. Below it the note does not render at all — a
//                     decoration that covers a heading is worse than one nobody
//                     sees.
//
//                     THE OFFSET USED TO BE 144 AND IT WAS WRONG BY 8px THE
//                     MOMENT SOMEBODY ELSE'S SPACING PASS TOOK `.section` from
//                     px-8 to px-6. 144 leaves 16px of the note inside the
//                     container and relies on the padding to cover it, so the
//                     clearance was (padding - 16): 16px under px-8, and 8px
//                     under px-6 — 2px once the tilt is counted, which is a note
//                     touching the heading. An offset equal to the width has no
//                     such coupling; only the breakpoint has to move if the cap
//                     does.
//
//                     Two more ways to get this wrong, both of which shipped
//                     once: an offset SMALLER than the note leaves most of it
//                     over the text at every width, and gating on `xl:` (1280px)
//                     shows the note at precisely the breakpoint where the
//                     gutter is zero.
//
//   place="flow"    — for sections whose content is a LEFT-ALIGNED max-w-3xl
//                     column. There are several hundred px of genuinely empty
//                     container to the right of those, so the note sits INSIDE
//                     at a small positive inset and appears from lg up rather
//                     than waiting for a 1760px monitor. Most readers only ever
//                     see these ones.
//
//                     A CENTRED section is never a flow section, however narrow
//                     its heading looks. #join reads as a 3xl column and is not
//                     one: the paragraph under it carries `.measure`, which is
//                     44em of ITS OWN font-size — 44 x 24px = 1050px at body-lg,
//                     wider than max-w-3xl and centred, so the free column is
//                     ~80px a side and a note there overlaps the copy by 100px+.
//                     Sections like that take a gutter note or none.
//
//                     IT IS ANCHORED BESIDE ITS COLUMN, NOT AGAINST THE
//                     CONTAINER'S RIGHT EDGE, and `anchor` is the whole of that
//                     — see the prop below. A flush-right flow note is correct
//                     at lg and wrong at every width above it: the column it
//                     annotates is CAPPED, so its ink stops at a fixed x while
//                     the container keeps growing, and a note held against the
//                     far edge drifts away from the thing it is annotating.
//                     Measured, before this was fixed: 263px of gap beside
//                     #mentors and 438px beside #why-us at 1800, i.e. a note
//                     marooned in the middle of an empty half-section, reading
//                     as decoration sent out to fill the margin rather than as a
//                     remark about the paragraph.
//
//                     The clamp in `.note-flow` keeps the old flush-right
//                     behaviour at the widths where there is no room for
//                     anything better, so nothing has to be gated on a
//                     breakpoint.
//
// A negative inset that hangs off the SCREEN rather than into a margin is not
// caught by anything: `body { overflow-x: hidden }` clips the strip silently
// instead of producing a scrollbar, and scripts/qa.mjs samples 390, 834 and 1440.
// Hence flush by default, negative only past 1760px, and never a bare `-left-*`
// written at a call site.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// VERTICAL SPACING, which is a page-level property and therefore cannot be
// decided here. NO TWO NOTES SHARE A HORIZONTAL LEVEL. Past 1760px a section can
// carry one in each margin, and two notes level with each other read as a pair of
// wings bolted to a heading — the eye takes them as one symmetrical ornament
// instead of two remarks, and the tilts that are supposed to look casual start
// looking like a mirrored pattern. So where a section holds two, the gutter one
// is dropped clear of the flow one's band: #calendar and #culture both do this,
// and the numbers at those call sites are the flow note's measured foot plus a
// gap, not taste.
//
// scripts/tmp-measure.mjs prints every decoration's document-y band and flags any
// pair within 40px of each other. Run it after moving one.
//
// NOT aria-hidden, unlike the margin stickers. A sticker is a three-word joke
// that reads as an interruption between a heading and its paragraph; these carry
// whole sentences that say something the section does not, so they are worth
// hearing. Keep it that way when adding one — if a note has nothing to say
// beyond decoration, it should be a sticker instead.
