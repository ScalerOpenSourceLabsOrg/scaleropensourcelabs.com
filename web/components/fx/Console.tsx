// The footer easter egg: a one-line shell that actually does something.
//
// NOT fixed to the viewport, and that is a deliberate departure from "a bar at the
// bottom of the page". StickyCTA is already `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0` and already
// reserves 4.5rem of body padding to avoid covering the footer; a second fixed bar
// would either sit on top of it or need a second reservation, and two permanently
// docked bars on a phone is most of the screen gone. In the footer it is a reward
// for reaching the bottom, which is what an easter egg should be.
//
// Everything here degrades. With JavaScript off it is an inert text input in a
// footer — visibly a toy, not a broken control.
