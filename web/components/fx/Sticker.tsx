// The margin stickers — three developer in-jokes stuck into the empty gutters.
//
// A server component. There is no state here and no drag: the brief says
// "draggable / hover", and hover is the half worth building. A dragged sticker
// needs pointer capture, a position store, a touch story and a decision about what
// happens on reload, and the payoff is that one reader in a thousand moves a joke
// two inches. The wobble costs four lines of CSS and every reader gets it.
//
// TWO RULES THIS COMPONENT EXISTS TO ENFORCE, both learned the hard way on this
// page:
//
//   1. lg AND UP ONLY. These are absolutely positioned into margins that only
//      exist on a wide screen. On a phone they land on top of the copy or off the
//      left edge — and `body { overflow-x: hidden }` means an escaped element is
//      clipped silently rather than reported by the overflow check in
//      scripts/qa.mjs. Nothing catches this but looking at it.
//
//   2. The VISIBILITY AND POSITION LIVE ON THIS WRAPPER, never on the `.chip`
//      inside it. `.chip` declares `display: inline-block`, and globals.css is
//      emitted after Tailwind's utilities layer, so a `hidden lg:block` on the
//      chip itself loses the specificity tie and applies nothing at all.
//
// aria-hidden throughout: these are jokes, not information, and read aloud between
// a heading and its paragraph they are pure interruption.

      VIOLET AND MINT ARE GONE. A sticker is decoration, and decoration is where a
      palette leaks: those two were the only violet and the only decorative mint on
      the site, so three stickers carried two colours nothing else used. Blue is the
      ink here and yellow is the one thing louder than it; a sticker gets one of
      those or it gets the default. The mint that remains is semantic — the "OSC
      way" / "Old way" pair and "OSC club" — and it stays because it is saying
      something rather than decorating. */
