# Contributing

This is the Scaler Open Source Club's own website, and it is also meant to be a
first open-source contribution for club members. If this is your first pull request
anywhere, you are the intended audience — say so in the PR and someone will walk
you through it.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScalerOpenSourceLabsOrg/scaleropensourcelabs.com.git
cd scaleropensourcelabs.com/web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
                     # port 3000 is often taken; use `npm run dev -- -p 3001`
                     # and pass SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001 to the checks
```

No credentials, no database, no `.env`. If `npm run dev` needs anything from you
beyond those commands, that is a bug — please open an issue.

## The files that matter

Almost every contribution is an edit to one file under **`web/content/`**. They hold
all the site's content as typed arrays, one module per page, so you do not need to
touch a React component to add a person, a project, or an answer.

| File | What lives there | Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `site.ts` | Links, the page list, the footer's institutional copy | every page |
| `essence.ts` | What open source is, career impact, the ICPC comparison, member stories | Essence |
| `projects.ts` | Build-day projects, club repos, upstream contributions | Projects |
| `programs.ts` | The seven programmes, tiers, the reverse clock | Programs |
| `people.ts` | Core team, alumni, achievers, organisations | Hall of Fame |
| `join.ts` | The four entry paths, what we look for, culture, FAQ, form options | How to Join |

This used to be a single `club.ts`. It was split when the site became five pages,
because one 800-line file holding five pages' content meant every content PR touched
it and every one of them conflicted.

> **Editing the join form's options?** `join.ts` holds the four paths, the two hostels
> and the programme list — and `firestore.rules` at the repo root keeps a **second copy**
> of those values, because Firestore rules cannot import anything. Change one without the
> other and every member who picks the new option gets a permission error on save, while
> the page still renders perfectly. Run `npm run rules` to check, and see
> [FIREBASE.md](FIREBASE.md).
>
> The signed-in half of the site — `/join`, `/onboarding`, `/dashboard`, `/admin` — is not
> content and does not live in `web/content/`. Nothing there is published on the site; see
> FIREBASE.md before changing it.

```ts
// content/people.ts
export const ACHIEVERS: Achiever[] = [
  {
    name: "Full Name",
    achievement: { kind: "programme", programme: "GSOC" },  // or { kind: "hackathon", event: "..." }
    year: "2026",
    org: "The organisation that selected them",
    work: "One specific sentence on what they actually built.",
    photo: "/people/full-name.jpg", // optional
    github: "their-login",          // optional
    url: "https://link-that-proves-it",
    consented: true,                // REQUIRED — see below
  },
];
```

Run `npm run typecheck`. If it passes, the shape is right.

### Placeholder content, and why it is there

Several sections render obvious placeholders — "Placeholder One", "Example
Foundation" — in development and **nothing at all** in production. That is
deliberate: a card grid cannot be designed or reviewed against an empty array, but a
production build must never ship an invented name. The switch is
`process.env.NODE_ENV`, so it is structural rather than a note asking somebody to
remember.

When you add real entries, the placeholders disappear on their own — the
`published*()` helpers return real content whenever there is any. Do not delete the
scaffolds; the next person redesigning that section needs them.

## Two rules that get PRs closed

### 1. Nobody appears on this site without their own permission

Every person entry carries `consented`. Anything not explicitly `true` is filtered
out and never rendered.

Do not set `consented: true` on someone else's behalf because you think they would
not mind. These are named students, with photos, shown to an international
audience — including people who may not want their name attached to a specific
organisation publicly. Ask them, then set the flag.

### 2. Every factual claim carries a link to a primary source

The site has no testimonials and no placement statistics. External verifiability is
the only thing making it credible, and the whole page is built on "you can check
this". So:

- A number needs a link to the page that states that number.
- The linked page must state **the same** number. Citing 1,272 while linking a
  source that says 1,280 is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent — that
  one shipped once and had to be corrected.
- If you cannot find a primary source, the claim does not go in. This has already
  cost two good-sounding lines: an invented "only 9 people per college make ICPC"
  figure that no rulebook or dataset produces, and "open source is an easier door
  than ICPC", which is false — GSoC 2025 accepted 1,280 of 15,240 applicants.

A weaker claim you can prove beats a stronger one you cannot.

## Writing

Match the voice already there. Concretely:

- **Say what happened, not how it felt.** "Merged a parser fix into OpenCRE" beats
  "made an amazing contribution".
- **No adjectives describing people.** Attach them to work instead.
- **Sentence case.** No exclamation marks.
- **Prefer the specific.** "Three terms a year" beats "runs frequently".

## Before you open a pull request

```bash
npm run typecheck    # must pass
npm run palette      # must pass — categorical colour constraints
npm run build        # must pass
npm run smoke        # needs `npm run dev` in another terminal
npm run qa           # must report 0 issues — same
npm run browsers     # all three engines
```

`npm run qa` drives real Chromium across **every route** × four viewports × both
themes — 80 combinations. It checks contrast, tap-target sizes, text size, heading
order, alt text, horizontal overflow, and that `.tap` is never combined with a margin
utility. **Zero issues is the bar**, and it is not negotiable for a site whose
audience includes people reading it on a phone on campus wifi.

`npm run smoke` is the one that catches a dead bundle: it asserts hydration, the Join
button's visibility on every route, and that the outline and scroll reveals re-derive
after a client-side navigation. Run it before `qa`, because a page serving no
JavaScript passes most of what `qa` checks.

**Both of those run signed out**, so on `/onboarding` and `/dashboard` they only ever see
the "sign in first" card. If you touched sign-in, the profile form, the dashboard or
anything under `/admin`, a green run there means the door is not broken and nothing more —
the signed-in half is covered by `npm run e2e:auth`, which drives the whole flow in a real
browser against the Auth and Firestore emulators, and by `npm run rules:emulator`, which
executes `firestore.rules` as several different people. Both need the emulators running;
see [FIREBASE.md](FIREBASE.md).

If you changed anything visual, also **look at it in both themes**. On this project
that has caught bugs every single time — including a wordmark rendering at 1.11:1
(black on black) that every automated checker passed, because the checker read the
declared token and the element was rendering transparent.

> Do not run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running. They share `.next`, so
> the build deletes the chunks the dev server is serving. The page still returns
> 200 and looks fine, but no JavaScript loads. Recover with `rm -rf .next` and a
> restart; `node scripts/smoke.mjs` confirms.

## Pull requests

- One change per PR. A content addition and a layout refactor are two PRs.
- Say what you changed and why. If it is visual, attach a before/after screenshot
  in both themes.
- Link the issue if there is one.
- Do not commit `study/` output, `node_modules`, `.next`, or any `.env` file. All
  are gitignored already; if something slipped through, that is worth an issue.

## Good first issues

Look for the `good first issue` label. Genuinely useful starting points:

- Add an achiever, a project or a core team member to the right file in
  `web/content/` (with consent + proof).
- Add an FAQ entry for a question you actually had before joining.
- Fix a `npm run qa` failure on a viewport we have not looked at closely.
- Improve a section's copy to be more specific and less promotional.

## Code of conduct

Be straightforward and useful. Review the code, not the person. Nobody here is
expected to already know how open source works — that is the entire point of the
club.
